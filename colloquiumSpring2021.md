title: Spring 2021 Department Colloquium
---

Due to the pandemic, the NAU Department of Mathematics and Statistics Colloquium will be held via Zoom. The talks will typically take place on Thursdays at 4:00-5:00pm. Please contact <a href="mailto:nandor.sieben@nau.edu">Nandor Sieben</a> to obtain the Zoom information or to be added to the mailing list that includes the Zoom information.

### Thursday 2/25 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Janos Englander (University of Colorado Boulder)

**Title:** Turning a coin instead of tossing it

**Abstract:** Given a sequence of numbers $\\{p_n\\}$ in $[0,1]$, consider the following experiment. First, we flip a fair coin and then, at step $n$, we turn the coin over to the other side with probability $p_n$, $n\geq 2$. What can we say about the distribution of the empirical frequency of heads as $n\to \infty$? We show that a number of phase transitions take place as the turning gets slower (i.e., $p_n$ is getting smaller), leading first to the breakdown of the Central Limit Theorem and then to that of the Law of Large Numbers. It turns out that the critical regime is $p_n=\text{const}/n$. Among the scaling limits, we obtain some well-known special (Uniform, Gaussian, Semicircle and Arcsine) laws. The talk is intended to a general audience and no expertise in probability is assumed!

## Thursday 3/4 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Steve Wilson (NAU emeritus)

**Title:** The Diagram Quest

**Abstract:** A semiregular symmetry in a graph is a symmetry which moves all the vertices in cycles of the same length. The ‘diagram’ of such a symmetry has one ’node’ for each cycle and ‘links’ joining nodes, one for each orbit of edges joining vertices of those cycles. We will see what we can learn about the graph from the diagram, and how to re-construct the graph from the diagram. We will discuss what makes a diagram ‘good’ and how to find ‘good’ diagrams.

## Thursday 3/11 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Jim Swift (NAU)

**Title:** TBA

**Abstract:** TBA

## Thursday 3/18 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** László Erdős

**Title:** Order and disorder in mathematical physics

**Abstract:** We review a few mathematical problems that were motivated from the quantum physics of disordered systems. They have inspired entirely new directions in mathematics such as quantum chaos and random matrices. In this talk we will present some basic results and major open conjectures in these areas. The talk will be accessible without physics background.

## Thursday 4/8 at 4:00-4:50
