### Tuesday 10/18 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Natali Hritonenko (Prairie View A&M, Texas)

**Title:** To Mitigate or Adapt to Climate Change: Modeling approach

**Abstract:** The presentation will start with a brief introduction of ongoing and prospective research directions. The talk will focus on mathematical modelling and analysis of two related contemporary issues (a) modernization of industrial equipment under fast technological development and (b) environment adaptation and pollution mitigation as two main strategies to deal with climate change and industrial contamination.

The considered deterministic ODE model that portrays complex interrelations of production, pollution, and the environmental protection is a result of intensive collaborative efforts of mathematicians, economists, and environmentalists.
Volterra integral equations of the second kind are used to model rational capital replacement under scientific and technological innovations, government quotas, and environmental constraints.

Different extensions and modifications of the models as well as developed methods of their investigation and applied interpretation of obtained results will be presented. A short survey of other quantitative and qualitative modelling approaches to solve these problems will be provided.

### Tuesday 10/11 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Jaechoul Lee (NAU)

**Title:** Lag time between state-level policy interventions and changepoints in U.S. COVID-19 outcomes

**Abstract:** Public health policy implemented at the state level has been important in managing the spread of
COVID-19. State governments have had to balance the need to reduce the spread of COVID-19 with the public's desire to return to normal life. As a result, there are both restrictive policies and reopening policies that influence social behavior and consequentially the spread of COVID-19. Here, we describe the relationship between changes in the trajectory of COVID-19 cases and deaths and policy implementations. For this, we first detect changepoints in the COVID-19 outcomes using a data-driven search algorithm and then relate these changepoints to implemented policies. Particularly, we show that there is a change in COVID-19 outcomes approximately 10–14 days after state-level policy implementation. This work can help health officials understand the time it will take for state-level policies to have an impact on the trajectory of a highly infectious illness like COVID-19. Knowing that there is a significant lag time between policy implementation and its effect on the spread of disease can help officials be more proactive in responding to health crises. Limitations and further research opportunities will be discussed at the end of the talk.

### Tuesday 10/3 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Angie Hodge (NAU)

**Title:** Math Pathways: Arizona and Beyond

**Abstract:** In August 2022, Arizona was selected to be a part of the Dana Center’s Launch Years Initiative. Come find out what all of this means to Arizona and specifically to the NAU Department of Mathematics and Statistics. In this talk, I will share the work I’ve been doing with the Arizona Pathways statewide team (including monthly virtual meetings and a meeting in DC with the Conference Board of Mathematical Sciences). I will also gather feedback from attendees on their thoughts about the initiative.

### Tuesday 9/27 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** John Neuberger (NAU)

**Title:** Splines, Direction Fields, and ODE Solvers

**Abstract:** We will start with an introduction to the famous cubic spline interpolator from MAT 362 Intro to Numerical Analysis, which we implement as a single linear system defined with block matrices. We will see how to modify the linear system to approximate solutions to linear ODE. For nonlinear ODE we obtain a nonlinear system, which can be solved by Newton’s method. The talk concludes with some ideas about various algorithms derived from this way of thinking, along with some open questions and ongoing research topics.

### Tuesday 9/13 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Title:** Twin groups and doodles

**Abstract:** I will give an introduction to twin groups as an excuse to talk about classical configuration spaces, configuration spaces on graphs, hyperplane arrangements, and Coxeter groups. Twin groups were discovered or invented by Mikhael Khovanov in the mid-1990's, before he famously categorified the Jones polynomial. The origins lie in the $K(\pi,1)$ problem for hyperplane arrangements, and the groups themselves are right-angled Coxeter groups related to doodles on the two-dimensional sphere and Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant, which aspects I will explain to the extent I am able. The title of the talk is from Khovanov's paper.

### Tuesday 9/6 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Jim Swift (NAU)

**Title:** Solving $2\times 2$ matrix Initial Value Problems without computing eigenvectors

**Abstract:** We present a simple algorithm for the solution to the ordinary differential equation $dx/dt = Ax$ with the initial condition $x(0) = x_0$, when $A$ is a $2\times 2$ real matrix. Solving this initial value problem is a topic in our lower division differential equations class, MAT 239 Ordinary Differential Equations. My solution does not require a computation of the eigenvectors of $A$, and is many times faster than the standard techniques found in the textbooks. But is the technique too easy, too cookbook, even for MAT 239? Should we teach this method to our students? I will invite a discussion.
This talk is in person with no zoom option. Knowledge of MAT 239 will be helpful, but not required, to understand the talk.
