### Tuesday 9/27 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** John Neuberger (NAU)

**Title:** Splines, Direction Fields, and ODE Solvers

**Abstract:** We will start with an introduction to the famous cubic spline interpolator from MAT 362 Intro to Numerical Analysis, which we implement as a single linear system defined with block matrices. We will see how to modify the linear system to approximate solutions to linear ODE. For nonlinear ODE we obtain a nonlinear system, which can be solved by Newtonâ€™s method. The talk concludes with some ideas about various algorithms derived from this way of thinking, along with some open questions and ongoing research topics.

### Tuesday 9/13 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Title:** Twin groups and doodles

**Abstract:** I will give an introduction to twin groups as an excuse to talk about classical configuration spaces, configuration spaces on graphs, hyperplane arrangements, and Coxeter groups. Twin groups were discovered or invented by Mikhael Khovanov in the mid-1990's, before he famously categorified the Jones polynomial. The origins lie in the $K(\pi,1)$ problem for hyperplane arrangements, and the groups themselves are right-angled Coxeter groups related to doodles on the two-dimensional sphere and Grothendieck's dessins d'enfant, which aspects I will explain to the extent I am able. The title of the talk is from Khovanov's paper.

### Tuesday 9/6 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Jim Swift (NAU)

**Title:** Solving $2\times 2$ matrix Initial Value Problems without computing eigenvectors

**Abstract:** We present a simple algorithm for the solution to the ordinary differential equation $dx/dt = Ax$ with the initial condition $x(0) = x_0$, when $A$ is a $2\times 2$ real matrix. Solving this initial value problem is a topic in our lower division differential equations class, MAT 239 Ordinary Differential Equations. My solution does not require a computation of the eigenvectors of $A$, and is many times faster than the standard techniques found in the textbooks. But is the technique too easy, too cookbook, even for MAT 239? Should we teach this method to our students? I will invite a discussion.
This talk is in person with no zoom option. Knowledge of MAT 239 will be helpful, but not required, to understand the talk.
