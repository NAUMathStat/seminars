### The Orlik-Solomon algebra: differential forms and cohomology ###

**Dates:** January 20, January 27, 2015

**Speaker:** Michael Falk

**Abstract:** We give a short proof of the isomorphism of the Orlik-Solomon algebra of a complex arrangement with an algebra of differential forms, and of the latter with the (De Rham) cohomology of the complement. As a corollary of the latter isomorphism, the complement is a formal space (in the sense of Sullivan). The proof uses a long exact sequence from elementary algebraic topology and the no-broken-circuit basis of the OS algebra.
