The Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Topology (ACGT) Seminar meets on Tuesdays at 12:45-2:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building. If you are interested/willing to give a talk, please contact [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io), ACGT Coordinator.

# Schedule Spring 2016 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Exploration of leading coefficients of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials over type affine $C$ Coxeter groups ###

**Dates:** 2/23, 3/1

**Speaker:** Kevin Salmon (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this series of talks, I will summarize the work I've done for my MS thesis involving the computation of the leading coefficients for the so-called Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials in Hecke algebras of type affine $C$.

### Milnor fibers of arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^3$ ###

**Dates:** 1/26, 2/2, 2/9, 2/16

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk](https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Abstract:** In a series of three or four lectures, we will outline a proof that the first homology of the Milnor fiber of a complex 3-arrangement is determined by the intersection lattice, resolving an old conjecture. In the first couple of lectures weâ€™ll lay the groundwork with a quick trip through 3-manifold topology, Seifert manifolds, plumbing, and equivariant resolution of weighted homogeneous singularities, in the special case of interest.
