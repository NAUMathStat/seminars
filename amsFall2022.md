title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

The Applied Mathematics Seminar (AMS) typically meets on Thursdays.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

### Fall 2022 Schedule

For Fall 2022 we are meeting from 3:00-4:00PPM in room 236A of the Lumberjack Mathematics Center (LMC), which is in Student Academic Services (SAS) building.
