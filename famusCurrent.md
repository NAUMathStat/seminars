The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. While Jeff Rushall is on sabbatical in Portugal, FAMUS is hosted by [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io).  

Come learn what mathematics is about and how the faculty ended up in our department at this popular event.

# Schedule Fall 2015 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Cube Solitaire ###

**Date:** October 30, 2015

**Speaker:** Andrew Lebovitz (NAU)

**Abstract:** A cube starts in the following configuration. A "move" consists of picking an edge and adding 1 to each of its vertices. The goal is to make all vertices be multiples of three. Can we win this game? If we can win, what is a winning sequence of moves? If we can't win, how can we prove that? We'll analyze the game on Friday, and (hopefully) solve it.

In lieu of interviewing Andrew after his talk, we will have a Halloween costume contest.  So, come wearing your best costume.  (And please come even if you don't plan on wearing a costume.)

### Gambling, Games of Chance, and Mathematics ###

**Date:** October 23, 2015

**Speaker and Guest:** Dr. Roy St. Laurent (NAU)

**Abstract:** Gambling is one of the earliest forms of human entertainment, going back over 4000 years. Interest in gambling is what prompted mathematicians in the 1600â€™s to develop probability as the mathematics of chance. I will talk about gambling problems, old and new, and how probability can be used to analyze chances of winning, optimal strategies to win, and other considerations.

### Are You (Quantitatively) Literate? ###

**Date:** October 16, 2015

**Speaker and Guest:** Dr. Brian Beaudrie (NAU)

**Abstract:** The essence of Quantitative Literacy is to use mathematical and logical thinking in context.  But sometimes that context might be difficult to grasp. We'll spend some time discussing what Quantitative Literacy (a.k.a. Quantitative Reasoning or Numeracy) is, and its importance in today's world; then, we'll try a few fun problems and examples that illustrate and develop quantitative literacy.

### Mapping Diagrams: Making Sense of Solving a Linear Equation ###

**Date:** October 9, 2015

**Speaker:** Dr. Martin Flashman (Humboldt State University)

**Abstract:** Solving simple linear equations is something taught in beginning algebra, but without connection to functions or a visualization that makes sense of the process. Professor Flashman will demonstrate how mapping diagrams can be used in the study of functions, inverses, and compositions to understand symbolic manipulations visually.

**Host:** Ellie Kennedy (NAU)

**Guest:** Sal Vera (NAU)

### Discrete Dynamical Systems ###

**Date:** October 2, 2015

**Speaker:** Dr. Terry Blows (NAU)

**Abstract:** Research in applied mathematics often connects to differential equations, but this is not a good topic for undergraduate research as a graduate course in this topic is often a prerequisite. But differential equations has a close relation in discrete dynamical systems, which in one-dimension has the form $x(n+1)=f(x(n))$. Start at $x(0)$, apply a rule to get $x(1)$, apply the same rule to get $x(2)$, etc. What happens in the limit as $n$ tends to infinity? Bring your calculator.

### Modeling Light Scattering to Solve Related Inverse Problems ###

**Date:** September 25, 2015

**Speaker:** Dustin Story (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this episode of FAMUS, Dustin Story will discuss the work he did during his summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates).  Here are the details. Capturing the effects of absorption and scattering on light passing through a medium has various applications in areas such as biomedical optics, atmospheric sciences, and several other areas of physics.  We study these effects, first using the Kubelka-Munk equations, and later using the radiative transfer equation. To find solutions to these equations, we study the associated generalized eigenvalue problems by taking advantage of several inherent symmetries. The symmetries are first established by analyzing the Kubelka-Munk system. Later, we establish these symmetries and apply them to find numerical solutions to the radiative transfer equation using the discrete ordinate method.  The solutions to these models lay the ground work for posing and solving related inverse problems. Optimization and root finding techniques are applied to approximate solutions for most inverse problems except in special cases where analytical approximations are available.  These solutions are extended to solve similar inverse problems in the field of medical imaging. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS15-09-25.pdf)]

### Proofs Without Words ###

**Date:** September 18, 2015

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this FAMUS talk, we'll explore several cool mathematical theorems from a visual perspective. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS15-09-18.pdf)] [[Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/dcernst/proofs-without-words-1)]

### The Friendship Paradox: Your friends, on average, have more friends than you do ###

**Date:** September 11, 2015

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) (NAU)

**Abstract:** The Friendship Paradox is the observation that your friends, on average, have more friends than you do. This phenomenon, which was first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991, is mathematically provable. In this episode of FAMUS, we will discuss the "paradox", sketch its proof, and explore some applications.  The idea for the talk was inspired by a [post by Richard Green](https://plus.google.com/101584889282878921052/posts/cHo5dMTQdsW) on Google+.
