The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).  

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### Should you consider graduate school in statistics or mathematics education or mathematics? ###

**Date:** December 2, 2016

**Speaker:** Derek Sonderegger (NAU)

**Abstract:**  The presentation is being given by Dr. Derek Sonderegger, who is a member of the graduate operations committee here in our department.  He will give the who/what/when/how/why of considering graduate school, applying for graduate school, and being successful in graduate school, and his comments will be directed at the graduate programs in our department.  The "guests" this week will be several current and former graduate students in our department, who will present all sorts of interesting and colorful thoughts on the joys of attending graduate school in math/stat/math ed here at NAU.  FREE PIZZA will be served.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-12-02.pdf)]

### Are you a topological pool shark? ###

**Date:** November 18, 2016

**Speaker:** Kathryn Bryant (Colorado College)

**Abstract:**  The classic game of pool/billiards is played on a table. Traditionally, pool tables are flat, tend to have six pockets, and have four bounding walls that prevent the billiard balls from escaping the table. Which of these table characteristics are topological properties? What happens to the game of pool if we change some/all of these properties? Can YOU make a shot on a torus? This talk will be an interactive exploration of the topological properties of a surface that may (or may not!) make it desirable for pool.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is also Kathryn.
