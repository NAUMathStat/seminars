The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### Ramanujan's Impossible Sum

**Date:** Friday, September 17

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The topic this week is the Ramanujan's Impossible Sum, and deals with that funny-looking $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots = -1/12$ formula.  I'll show why the formula seems to be true, why it seems to be nonsense, and do my best to make fun of mathematicians who believe it (like me), mathematicians who don't believe it (like me), and physicists who may or may not believe it (including Dr. David Cole from the Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science here at NAU, who will be attending).

The faculty guest will be Matt Fahy.

### The Collatz Conjecture

**Date:** Friday, September 10

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The topic this week is the Collatz Conjecture, a simple yet devilishly difficult unsolved problem in number theory. See the flyer linked below for more information.

The faculty guest will be [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com).  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-09-10.pdf)]
