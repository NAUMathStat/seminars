The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Turan's Brick Factory Problem

**Date:** Friday, October 22

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** During World War II, Hungarian mathematician Paul Turan, being Jewish, was forced to work in labor camps.  At one of these camps - a brick factory - he encountered a situation that led to a new mathematical idea and lots of subsequent research in graph theory.  Come for the drama, stay for the math and
free candy.

The faculty guest will be Ian Williams. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-10-22.pdf)]

### Ramanujan

**Date:** Friday, October 15

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The talk will delve into Ramanujan's mysterious life and his even more mysterious mathematics.  I'll do my best to show some of his more amazing formulas.

The faculty guest will be Ellie Blair. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-10-15.pdf)]

### Cantor Sets, Sierpinski Carpets and Menger Sponges

**Date:** Friday, October 8

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** Is it possible for a 3-D object to have finite volume but infinite surface area?  The answer is YES.  We will talk about such an object, along with 2-D and 1-D versions of the same counterintuitive beast.  We will also see pictures of egg dishes and cookies that are inspired by the same ideas.  

The faculty guest will be Shannon Guerrero. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-10-08.pdf)]

### The Shoelacing Counting Problem

**Date:** Friday, October 1

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** There are MANY different ways to lace up shoes.  After explaining the rules associated with "lacing up" a pair of shoes, we will see how many ways there are  to lace up shoes.  No prior knowledge of shoe lacing is required.

The faculty guest will be Tyler Brock. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-10-01.pdf)]

### Tragic Deaths in Mathematics History

**Date:** Friday, September 24

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** This week's talk deals with just a few of the historic figures in our discipline that met untimely and/or gross and/or tragic ends.

The faculty guest will be Gina Nabours. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-09-24.pdf)]

### Ramanujan's Impossible Sum

**Date:** Friday, September 17

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The topic this week is the Ramanujan's Impossible Sum, and deals with that funny-looking $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots = -1/12$ formula.  I'll show why the formula seems to be true, why it seems to be nonsense, and do my best to make fun of mathematicians who believe it (like me), mathematicians who don't believe it (like me), and physicists who may or may not believe it (including Dr. David Cole from the Department of Astronomy and Planetary Science here at NAU, who will be attending).

The faculty guest will be Matt Fahy.

### The Collatz Conjecture

**Date:** Friday, September 10

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The topic this week is the Collatz Conjecture, a simple yet devilishly difficult unsolved problem in number theory. See the flyer linked below for more information.

The faculty guest will be [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com).  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS21-09-10.pdf)]
