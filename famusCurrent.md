The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).  

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

# Schedule Spring 2017 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### The Urinal Problem ###

**Date:** February 3, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  Some social scientists and mathematicians have investigated various kinds of privacy questions, such as:

- Where should I choose to sit in a movie theater to maximize the chance of not having someone sit in front of me?
- Where should I choose to sit in on an open-seat flight to maximize the chance of not having someone sit next to me?
- Where should I choose to sit at a multi-table banquet to minimize the chance of having strangers sit on both sides of me?

Well, as the talk title suggests, these privacy concerns have also been researched in the context of urinal privacy.  Come to FAMUS to learn a bit about the history of this problem, the various ways it can be attacked, and to see LOTS of pictures and cartoons involving urinals.

### Two Talks Summarizing Undergraduate Research Projects ###

**Date:** January 27, 2017

#### Tree of Primitive Pythagorean Quadruples ####

**Speakers:** Marcela Gutierrez and Courtney Schmitt (undergraduates at NAU)

**Abstract:** A primitive Pythagorean triple is a 3-tuple of natural numbers sharing no nontrivial common factors that satisfies the Pythagorean Theorem.  Hall (1970) and Price (2008) found distinct perfect infinite ternary trees whose vertex sets are precisely all primitive Pythagorean triples. This talk will present progress towards the construction of an infinite tree whose vertex set consist of all primitive Pythagorean quadruples, i.e., 4-tuples $(a, b, c, d)$ of natural numbers sharing no nontrivial common factors that satisfy $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2$.

#### A Game of Chance Inspired by Othello ####

**Speaker:** Alexandria Medeck

**Abstract:** Inspired by the board game Othello, consider a one-player game of chance on a 4-by-8 board where the new twist on the game includes choosing your color disk, white or black, and the objective is to get four disks of the chosen color in a line. The more lines you complete, the more "money" you win. Consider a mathematical generalization, representing the game board by an r by c matrix, r< c. Each entry in the matrix is an independent Bernoulli random variable (i.e., either 1 or 0 with probability $p$ and $1âˆ’p$, respectively). The result is a random matrix. Associated with each possible matrix outcome is a score based on the number of completed vertical and diagonal lines of r ones in the matrix. My research is focused on determining the probability distribution of the score as a function of $r$ and $c$. I will present results concerning the probability structure of the game.

The faculty guest this week is Ellie Kennedy (NAU).

### Should you consider graduate school in statistics or mathematics education or mathematics? ###

**Date:** December 2, 2016

**Speaker:** Derek Sonderegger (NAU)

**Abstract:**  The presentation is being given by Dr. Derek Sonderegger, who is a member of the graduate operations committee here in our department.  He will give the who/what/when/how/why of considering graduate school, applying for graduate school, and being successful in graduate school, and his comments will be directed at the graduate programs in our department.  The "guests" this week will be several current and former graduate students in our department, who will present all sorts of interesting and colorful thoughts on the joys of attending graduate school in math/stat/math ed here at NAU.  FREE PIZZA will be served.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-12-02.pdf)]

### Are you a topological pool shark? ###

**Date:** November 18, 2016

**Speaker:** Kathryn Bryant (Colorado College)

**Abstract:**  The classic game of pool/billiards is played on a table. Traditionally, pool tables are flat, tend to have six pockets, and have four bounding walls that prevent the billiard balls from escaping the table. Which of these table characteristics are topological properties? What happens to the game of pool if we change some/all of these properties? Can YOU make a shot on a torus? This talk will be an interactive exploration of the topological properties of a surface that may (or may not!) make it desirable for pool.
