The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

**Abstract:** During the summer of 2019, I did some interesting things.  I took some trips, did some math, did some GRADING, etc.  I'll show pictures and explain how I filled my summer, focusing occasionally on mathematics. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS19-09-06.pdf)]
