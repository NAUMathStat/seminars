The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. While Jeff Rushall is on sabbatical in Portugal, FAMUS is hosted by [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io).  

Come learn what mathematics is about and how the faculty ended up in our department at this popular event.
