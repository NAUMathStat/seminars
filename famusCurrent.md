The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).  

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### My 2015-2016 Sabbatical Year ###

**Date:** October 21, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  In this presentation, I will explain what a sabbatical is, why they exist, and then will tell a few math stories and several travel stories (my family and I went to Europe for the year).  And yes, there will be pictures o'plenty.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-10-21.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Shannon Guerrero (NAU).

### The Shoelace Counting Problem ###

**Date:** October 14, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  The Shoelace Counting Problem is simple to state: how many different ways can one lace a "normal" pair of shoes ("normal" means that the shoes have laces, and eyelets, and so on).  It turns out that this is kind of a tricky - and entertaining - counting problem.  And it turns out that there are several different answers to the question!  It also turns out that having a lot of experience tying and lacing shoes doesn't really help answer these questions.  I will bring visual aids to aid in my presentation.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Todd Wolford (NAU).

### G&ouml;del's Theorem ###

**Date:** October 7, 2016

**Speaker:** Ian Williams (NAU)

**Abstract:**  A theorem so profound it forever changed the philosophy of math, G&ouml;del's work questions the very nature of what we can know through and about mathematics.  And the implications of this result are so mesmerizing, so deep, so novel that we will condense a couple years of graduate math and philosophy into 35 minutes and only talk about the really interesting parts. Listen carefully.  And as always, I will teach my secret techniques for recalling from memory the digits of $\pi$ up to any length.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Matt Fahy (NAU).

### The Tower of Hanoi, Part II ###

**Date:** September 30, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  I gave a FAMUS a few years ago on the Tower of Hanoi; this talk will be an update on the well-known puzzle (hence the "Part II" in the talk title).  In addition to introducing some new variations of the puzzle, I will discuss the recently-published solution to the 4-peg puzzle.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-09-30.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Roy St. Laurent (NAU).

### Curious and Unusual Numbers ###

**Date:** September 23, 2016

**Speaker:** Ian Williams (NAU)

**Abstract:** An introduction and shallow exposition concerning the numbers I find the most fascinating, cool, strange and spooky.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Christina (NAU).

### The Tree of Pythagorean Triples ###

**Date:** September 16, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** A Pythagorean triple is any set of three positive integers - like (3, 4, 5) or (5, 10, 15) or (5, 12, 13) - that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.  It has been known for a long, long time that there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples.  But it's only in the last couple of decades that mathematicians have found some clever ways of listing and organizing all of them.  This talk will explain how one presents all Pythagorean triples, and will describe some related open/unsolved questions.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-09-16.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is [Dana Ernst](http://dcernst/github.io) (NAU).

### The Impossible Sum ###

**Date:** September 9, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The talk will investigate the infinite sum $1+2+3+\cdots$ and will show why this sum exists and is important. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-09-09.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Ian Williams (NAU).
