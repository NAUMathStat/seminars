The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. While Jeff Rushall is on sabbatical in Portugal, FAMUS is hosted by [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io).  

Come learn what mathematics is about and how the faculty ended up in our department at this popular event.

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Discrete Dynamical Systems ###

**Date:** October 2, 2015

**Speaker and Guest:** Dr. Terry Blows (NAU)

**Abstract:** Research in applied mathematics often connects to differential equations, but this is not a good topic for undergraduate research as a graduate course in this topic is often a prerequisite. But differential equations has a close relation in discrete dynamical systems, which in one-dimension has the form $x(n+1)=f(x(n))$. Start at $x(0)$, apply a rule to get $x(1)$, apply the same rule to get $x(2)$, etc. What happens in the limit as $n$ tends to infinity? Bring your calculator.

### Modeling Light Scattering to Solve Related Inverse Problems ###

**Date:** September 25, 2015

**Speaker:** Dustin Story (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this episode of FAMUS, Dustin Story will discuss the work he did during his summer REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates).  Here are the details. Capturing the effects of absorption and scattering on light passing through a medium has various applications in areas such as biomedical optics, atmospheric sciences, and several other areas of physics.  We study these effects, first using the Kubelka-Munk equations, and later using the radiative transfer equation. To find solutions to these equations, we study the associated generalized eigenvalue problems by taking advantage of several inherent symmetries. The symmetries are first established by analyzing the Kubelka-Munk system. Later, we establish these symmetries and apply them to find numerical solutions to the radiative transfer equation using the discrete ordinate method.  The solutions to these models lay the ground work for posing and solving related inverse problems. Optimization and root finding techniques are applied to approximate solutions for most inverse problems except in special cases where analytical approximations are available.  These solutions are extended to solve similar inverse problems in the field of medical imaging. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS15-09-25.pdf)]

**Guest:** Dr. John Hagood (NAU)

### The Friendship Paradox: Your friends, on average, have more friends than you do ###

**Date:** September 11, 2015

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) (NAU)

**Abstract:** The Friendship Paradox is the observation that your friends, on average, have more friends than you do. This phenomenon, which was first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991, is mathematically provable. In this episode of FAMUS, we will discuss the "paradox", sketch its proof, and explore some applications.  The idea for the talk was inspired by a [post by Richard Green](https://plus.google.com/101584889282878921052/posts/cHo5dMTQdsW) on Google+.
