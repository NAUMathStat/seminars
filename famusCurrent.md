 The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).  

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

# Schedule Fall 2017 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Julia Sets (a.k.a. Complex Numbers in Motion) (a.k.a. Repeating Yourself Isn't Always a Bad Thing)  ###

**Date:** November 3, 2017

**Speaker:** Matt Fahy (NAU)

**Abstract:**  Complex numbers move around in interesting ways when subject to (even pretty simple) operations.  I will use a series of visualizations to investigate the motion of sets of complex numbers under certain functions and show how such investigation can result in famously strange geometric objects.

The faculty guest this week is, not surprisingly, Matt Fahy.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-11-03.pdf)]

### The ubiquitous Catalan numbers, part 2 ###

**Date:** October 27, 2017

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (NAU)

**Abstract:**  In last week's episode, we introduced the Catalan numbers and explored a few collections of objects that were counted by the Catalan numbers.  In this episode, we will start by reviewing what we covered last week and then play with a few more collections of objects, each of which is counted by the Catalan numbers.  Attendance at last week's talk not required.  

The faculty guest is Bahattin Yildiz, our new professor of mathematics.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-10-27.pdf)]

### The ubiquitous Catalan numbers ###

**Date:** October 20, 2017

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this talk, we will discuss my favorite sequence of numbers: the Catalan numbers.  The Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that crop up with surprising frequency in counting problems. The first few numbers in the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132.  After a brief history of the sequence, we will take a tour of several collections of objects, each of which is counted by the Catalan numbers. Our exploration will provide an introduction to a field of mathematics called enumerative combinatorics.

The faculty guest is Angie Hodge, our new professor of mathematics education.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-10-20.pdf)]

### The Cannonball Problem ###

**Date:** October 13, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The Cannonball Problem is the search for the magic number of cannonballs that can be both stacked into a perfectly-shaped square pyramid AND be laid out on the ground as a perfect square.  The problem goes back centuries, and the full tale includes talk of the Ancient Greeks, snowflakes and pirates.

The faculty guest is [Nandor Sieben](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/ns46/).  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-10-13.pdf)]

### Topological Quantum Computation: On Classification of Low-Dimensional Irreducible Representations of B5 ###

**Date:** October 6, 2017

**Speaker:** Etude Oneel-Judy (NAU undergrad)

**Abstract:** The design for a topological quantum computer is based on anyon braiding. It uses topology to protect quantum information against decoherence. We may model the space-time trajectory of a system of $n$ anyons with the $n$-strand braid group $B_n$. Storing and manipulating information in the representation spaces of $B_n$ is the foundation of Topological Quantum Computation. I developed an algorithm that allowed the classification of the unitarizable representations with dimension 5 or less for the braid group $B_5$.

The faculty guest is Ellie Kennedy.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-10-06.pdf)]

### Famous Mathematical Blunders ###

**Date:** September 29, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** This talk will present some moments in mathematical history where some well-known mathematicians made some semi-embarrassing mistakes while trying to solve some well-known problems.  It's a bit of history, a bit of comedy, and is intended to be both fun and enlightening.

The faculty guest is Sal Vera.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-09-29.pdf)]

### Gauss' Circle Problem ###

**Date:** September 22, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** This talk focuses on a famous puzzle first investigated by Gauss: counting the number of integer lattice points that lie inside a circle of radius "r" centered at the origin.  Much is known about this problem, but there are still some unanswered questions involving the preciseness of the formulas used for estimating the number of such points.    

The faculty guest this week is [Dr. Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com).  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-09-22.pdf)]

### Fermat Primes ###

**Date:** September 15, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will talk explain a curious piece of mathematical history - namely, the discovery of a special set of prime numbers that are now known as Fermat primes - and what their discoverer, Pierre de Fermat, got right and what he got wrong.  I will also explain why Fermat primes are still interesting today.   

The faculty guest this week is Dr. Terry Crites, who is our current department chair.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-09-15.pdf)]

### What did I do this summer? ###

**Date:** September 8, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will talk about the math I did, the traveling I did (to some semi-exotic places), and show you some really neat pictures (involving both math and traveling).  

The faculty guest this week is Amy Rushall, who (among many other very important things) happens to be the new Academic Director of the Lumberjack Math Center.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-09-08.pdf)]

<!-- ### How are AP calculus exams graded? [and where? and when? and by whom?] ###

**Date:** April 21, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will explain the who/what/when/etc. of grading AP calculus exams, something I have done for 11 straight years.  I will include how partial credit is awarded, which at times if very surprising.  I will also list some perks associated with being an AP grader.  

The faculty guest this week is Tiffany Lenhart.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-04-21.pdf)]

### OEIS ###

**Date:** April 14, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** OEIS stands for "Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences."  It is a very interesting website that allows one to access and investigate all sorts of neat number patterns.  It also has a reputation as a distracting, time-sucking, get-lost-down-the-rabbit-hole kind of website.  It is all of those things and more.  

The faculty guests two graduate students, Allie Steinken and Zachary Parker, who will discuss their lives as graduate students and answer any questions people might have about the joys and sorrows of graduate school. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-04-14.pdf)]

### Undergraduate Research in Mathematics at NAU ###

**Date:** April 7, 2017

**Speakers:** Faculty who want to mentor undergraduate research

**Abstract:** The structure of this particular FAMUS is nonstandard: we will see 7-10 short (circa 5 minutes) math "infomercials," one each from the following faculty (or surrogates):

- Nandor Sieben
- Shannon Guerrero
- Roy St. Laurent
- John Neuberger
- Jim Swift
- Dana Ernst  
- Jeff Rushall
- and possibly more

The theme of these short presentations is simple: they will each be a version of "I want to do undergrad research next year, here are the problems I want to investigate, and here are the qualifications I seek in prospective students." [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-04-07.pdf)]

### Quadratic and Cubic Residue Matrices ###

**Date:** March 24, 2017

**Speaker:** Pauline Gonzalez (undergraduate at NAU)

**Abstract:** The talk, Pauline will be reporting on an undergraduate research project she has been working on with fellow undergraduate Ryan Wood.  The project has involved building matrices using something like the Legendre symbol from MAT 318.    

After the talk, instead of a faculty interview, we will continue enjoying our refreshments--namely, some hors d'oeuvres--namely, cheese and crackers--and talk about the upcoming [SUnMaRC](https://naumathstat.github.io/sunmarc2017/) undergraduate mathematics conference, which happens here at NAU the weekend of March 31-April 2. There will be no faculty member interview this week. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-03-24.pdf)]

### Undergrad Research in Hadamard Matrices ###

**Date:** March 3, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this presentation I will do four things:

  1. Define a Hadamard matrix (they are special matrices featuring ONLY 1 or -1 for entries) and explain why are they interesting and important.  
  2. Talk about generalizations of Hadamard matrices (nothing to be scared about).  
  3. Discuss some undergrad research students who have worked with me in the past on some unsolved questions about Hadamard matrices, as well as where those students are now.
  4. Finally, I will show some new unsolved problems that I would like to work on with undergrads next year.  

So this FAMUS is like an infomercial.  Who is interested in doing undergrad research next year?  Students who are interested in doing undergrad research should come to FAMUS.  And those who aren't should come to FAMUS anyway. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-03-03.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Ben Lantz.

### What Exactly ARE Space and Time? ###

**Date:** February 24, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** Last week at FAMUS we saw a presentation on non-Euclidean space-time modeling, and aside from all the neat and weird geometry and complex numbers and so forth, it occurred to me that the very basics associated with all that - the measurement of space and time - are things that by themselves are tricky to define.  So this FAMUS will try to explain how we measure things.  Minimal math, lots of history, good stories: it's a great way to end the week. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-02-24.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Sal Vera.

### Non-Euclidean Geometry: Spacetime Modeling and the Central Problem of Modern Physics ###

**Date:** February 17, 2017

**Speaker:** Etude Oneel-Judy (undergraduate at NAU)

**Abstract:** Etude will be explaining the role that non-Euclidean geometry plays in helping to understand 21st century physics, most notably some of the work of Einstein.  The talk assumes no prior knowledge of non-Euclidean geometry or modeling or even of physics.  Etude has also promised to provide some 3D printing prizes to those lucky enough to attend! [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-02-17.pdf)]

### A Report on NCUWM - the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics ###

**Date:** February 10, 2017

**Speaker:** Amy Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** This talk will be given by the faculty representative who attended the conference, along with lots of input from the 4 students who also attended the conference.  What the conference is, why it is, who the 4 students were who attended the conference, and the impact it has on those who attend will be among the discussion topics. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS17-02-10.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is also Amy Rushall.

### The Urinal Problem ###

**Date:** February 3, 2017

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  Some social scientists and mathematicians have investigated various kinds of privacy questions, such as:

- Where should I choose to sit in a movie theater to maximize the chance of not having someone sit in front of me?
- Where should I choose to sit in on an open-seat flight to maximize the chance of not having someone sit next to me?
- Where should I choose to sit at a multi-table banquet to minimize the chance of having strangers sit on both sides of me?

Well, as the talk title suggests, these privacy concerns have also been researched in the context of urinal privacy.  Come to FAMUS to learn a bit about the history of this problem, the various ways it can be attacked, and to see LOTS of pictures and cartoons involving urinals.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Amy Rangel (NAU).

### Two Talks Summarizing Undergraduate Research Projects ###

**Date:** January 27, 2017

**Talk 1:** Tree of Primitive Pythagorean Quadruples

**Speakers:** Marcela Gutierrez and Courtney Schmitt (undergraduates at NAU)

**Abstract:** A primitive Pythagorean triple is a 3-tuple of natural numbers sharing no nontrivial common factors that satisfies the Pythagorean Theorem.  Hall (1970) and Price (2008) found distinct perfect infinite ternary trees whose vertex sets are precisely all primitive Pythagorean triples. This talk will present progress towards the construction of an infinite tree whose vertex set consist of all primitive Pythagorean quadruples, i.e., 4-tuples $(a, b, c, d)$ of natural numbers sharing no nontrivial common factors that satisfy $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = d^2$.

**Talk 2:** A Game of Chance Inspired by Othello

**Speaker:** Alexandria Medeck (undergraduate at NAU)

**Abstract:** Inspired by the board game Othello, consider a one-player game of chance on a 4-by-8 board where the new twist on the game includes choosing your color disk, white or black, and the objective is to get four disks of the chosen color in a line. The more lines you complete, the more "money" you win. Consider a mathematical generalization, representing the game board by an r by c matrix, r< c. Each entry in the matrix is an independent Bernoulli random variable (i.e., either 1 or 0 with probability $p$ and $1−p$, respectively). The result is a random matrix. Associated with each possible matrix outcome is a score based on the number of completed vertical and diagonal lines of r ones in the matrix. My research is focused on determining the probability distribution of the score as a function of $r$ and $c$. I will present results concerning the probability structure of the game.
