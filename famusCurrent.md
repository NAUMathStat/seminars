The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### The Dating Game

**Date:** September 14, 2018

**Speaker:** [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (NAU)

**Abstract:** You're single and looking for love. In front of you are three doors. Behind each door is a prospective partner. Let’s assume that of the three people who are waiting behind the doors, there is a best match, a not so good match, and a least good match for you. Your mission is to couple up with your best possible match. Thankfully, I’m going to let you open some doors. But there are rules! To start, you select a door. It will open to reveal one of your potential suitors. If you want to choose this person as your match, you’re done and you don’t get to see either of the others. Risky! If you decide to move on, you discard the first person and they’re history. You select one of the two remaining doors. It opens to reveal someone else and again, you can choose this person as your match. But just like before, if you choose this person, you don’t get to see who is behind the final door. Nor are you allowed to return to the person you discarded behind the first door. If you decide to move on a second time, you select the final door. You must choose the person behind it as your match, whatever you think of them. Also risky! What strategy gives you the best chance of finding your best match?

This week's guest is also Dana Ernst - but his interview is going to be more of a "telling stories about his summer," most notably some little bike race he did in Colorado. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-14.pdf)]

### What did I do this summer?

**Date:** September 9, 2018

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will talk about the math I did, the traveling I did (to some semi-exotic places), and show you some really neat pictures (involving both math and traveling).  

The guests this week are department staff Bea Gallegos, Melina Miller and Mary Fule.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-07.pdf)]
