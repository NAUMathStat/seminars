The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

<!-- ### An Aperiodic Monotile

**Date:** Friday, November 17

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will talk about plane tilings and focus on the amazing monotile that aperiodically tiles the plane.  It was only "found" last November, and the story behind how it was found is kind of interesting.  

After the talk, the audience will play with that monotile to see how it covers the plane using a neat online program - so if you come, try to bring a laptop!  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS23-11-17.pdf)] -->
