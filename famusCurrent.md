The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. While Jeff Rushall is on sabbatical in Portugal, FAMUS is hosted by [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io).  

Come learn what mathematics is about and how the faculty ended up in our department at this popular event.

### The Friendship Paradox: Your friends, on average, have more friends than you do ###

**Date:** September 11, 2015

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) (NAU)

**Abstract:** The Friendship Paradox is the observation that your friends, on average, have more friends than you do. This phenomenon, which was first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991, is mathematically provable. In this episode of FAMUS, we will discuss the "paradox", sketch its proof, and explore some applications.  The idea for the talk was inspired by a [post by Richard Green](https://plus.google.com/101584889282878921052/posts/cHo5dMTQdsW) on Google+.
