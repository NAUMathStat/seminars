The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### The Congruent Number Problem

**Date:** Friday, October 4

**Speakers:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** A congruent number is a whole number that is the area of a right triangle whose side lengths are all rational numbers.  Finding all such natural numbers is known as the "congruent number problem," which dates back to antiquity.  I'll present a short history of the problem, show contributions made by Fibonacci, Fermat and others, and even mention their connection to elliptic curves.

### The Problem of the Calissons

**Date:** Friday, September 27

**Speakers:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** A calisson is a delightful French candy/cookie, often shaped as a rhombus.  Over a century ago, French bakers discovered a curious fact about hexagonal arrangements of calissons, namely this: when filling the hexagon, there are equal numbers of all three rhombus orientations (see the attached flyer for a visual example).  But mathematicians didn't come around to investigate the problem until the late 1980s.  In this talk, I'll discuss the problem, show a couple of solutions, and possibly even serve some calissons.

### Proving a Claim: Mathematicians who were too persuasive

**Date:** Friday, September 20

**Speakers:** Zachary Parker (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this talk, Zachary will present some well-known (and a few not-so-well-known) examples of mistakes made by some well-known (and a few not-so-well-known) mathematicians.

The faculty guest is Mike Falk.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS19-09-20.pdf)]

### The Circulant Hadamard Matrix Conjecture

**Date:** Friday, September 13

**Speakers:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** A Hadamard matrix is an $n\times n$ matrix $M$ with $1$'s or $-1$'s for entries that satisfies a specific matrix equation, namely $MM^T = nI_n$.  Equivalently, $M$ has a biggest possible determinant value, namely $|n^{n/2}|$. In this talk I will present/explain all of this is a much different, down-to-earth way (you won't need to know anything about matrix equations or matrix determinants), and I'll discuss recent developments concerning a very famous conjecture about a specific type of Hadamard matrix.

### What did I do this summer?  

**Date:** Friday, September 6

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** During the summer of 2019, I did some interesting things.  I took some trips, did some math, did some GRADING, etc.  I'll show pictures and explain how I filled my summer, focusing occasionally on mathematics. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS19-09-06.pdf)]

After my talk, there will be a parade of important people who talk about important things.  They include:

- Gina Nabours talking about being a Math Jack.  
- Zoe Escarcega talking giving/receiving tutoring in the ASC and the MAP room.  
- Derek Sonderreger talking about the new BS in Data Science.  
- Kameron Filardi talking about the NAU Math Club.
