### The Happy Ending Problem

**Date:** Friday, September 16

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:**  The talk topic this week is "The Happy Ending Problem," so coined by Paul Erdos.  This topic is a mix of math, tragedy, and a love story.  The math revolves around a problem in planar geometry that involves convex polygons.  

The faculty guest interviewee is Tyler Brock, who will answer a prearranged set of humorous questions and show humorous pictures from his past.  In addition to being the first FAMUS of AY 2022-2023, both Math Club and the Putnam Exam will recruit from the students in attendance.
