The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).  

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### G&ouml;del's Theorem ###

**Date:** September 23, 2016

**Speaker:** Ian Williams (NAU)

**Abstract:** A theorem so profound it forever changed the philosophy of math, G&ouml;del's work questions the very nature of what we can know through and about mathematics.  And the implications of this result are so mesmerizing, so deep, so novel that we will condense a couple years of graduate math and philosophy into 35 minutes and only talk about the really interesting parts. Listen carefully.  And as always, I will teach my secret techniques for recalling from memory the digits of $\pi$ up to any length.

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Christina (NAU).

### The Tree of Pythagorean Triples ###

**Date:** September 16, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** A Pythagorean triple is any set of three positive integers - like (3, 4, 5) or (5, 10, 15) or (5, 12, 13) - that satisfy the Pythagorean Theorem.  It has been known for a long, long time that there are infinitely many Pythagorean triples.  But it's only in the last couple of decades that mathematicians have found some clever ways of listing and organizing all of them.  This talk will explain how one presents all Pythagorean triples, and will describe some related open/unsolved questions.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-09-16.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is [Dana Ernst](http://dcernst/github.io) (NAU).

### The Impossible Sum ###

**Date:** September 9, 2016

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The talk will investigate the infinite sum $1+2+3+\cdots$ and will show why this sum exists and is important. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS16-09-09.pdf)]

The faculty guest-to-be-interviewed is Ian Williams (NAU).
