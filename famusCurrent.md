The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### The Cannonball Problem

**Date:** Friday, March 24

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** The Cannonball Problem is an old-ish problem about stacking cannonballs that can be asked like this: "When considering the number of identical cannonballs needed to form a perfect square pyramid, which of these numbers is ALSO perfect squares?"  This is an entertaining problem: in addition to the neat math involved, it allows discussion of topics that include both wine barrels and pirates.  

The faculty guest is the recently-doctorized Bianca Leudeker.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS23-03-24.pdf)]

### Why should you think about grad school in math/stat/math ed?

**Date:** Friday, February 17

**Abstract:** Robert Buscaglia will be the point person discussing our graduate programs; some other faculty and a few grad students will offer testimonials about why grad school is so rewarding; and FREE PIZZA will be served as an enticement.

### Hackenbush

**Date:** Friday, February 10

**Speaker:** Matt Fahy (NAU)

**Abstract:** A brief glimpse into combinatorial game theory.  We'll show how analyzing a simple game can lead to a number system beyond the real numbers.

Matt will also be the faculty guest. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS23-02-10.pdf)]

### A Topological Property of Fullerenes

**Date:** Friday, February 3

**Speaker:** Maddy Cox (NAU undergraduate math major)

**Abstract:** Maddy will present progress on her undergraduate research project (joint work with Kaylee Freudenthal).  The research project involves analyzing fullerene graphs, and in particular seeing if they possess a specific topological/graph theoretic property.  

Maddy will also be the "guest."  She will discuss her recent experience attending the Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS23-02-03.pdf)]

### What are Random Graphs?

**Date:** Friday, January 20

**Speaker:** Alyssa Whittemore (former NAU undergraduate math major, recent PhD at University of Nebraska-Lincoln, currently senior research scientist at Boston Fusion)

**Abstract:**  Random graphs are in the magnificent intersection between graph theory and probability theory. Random Graphs were first studied in 1938. In 1959, the great Paul Erdős and Alfréd Rényi introduced one of the most famous models, the Erdős-Rényi model. Coincidentally, Edgar Gilbert introduced a graph model equivalent to the Erdős-Rényi model in 1959 independently. We will discuss both of these random graph models and some that have been studied since, including random geometric graphs.

Alyssa will also be the "faculty guest," for which she has prepared a slide presentation.  Here are her title and abstract for this second portion of FAMUS:

**Title:** A Random Walk with Math

**Abstract:** My journey with mathematics began in the fourth grade. My higher education in mathematics began as an undergraduate at NAU. Now, my career in mathematics has led me to Boston. I’ll share bits of my mathematical voyage and how it has gotten me to where I am now: a Senior Research Scientist at a government contractor in New England.
