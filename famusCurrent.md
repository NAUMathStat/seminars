The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### TikTok Math: Paper Folding

**Date:** Friday, September 22

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I saw a TikTok recently about paper folding, specifically, about how many times you need to fold a sheet of paper to make a stack tall enough to reach the moon.  I'll show the TikTok, explain why the scenario is sort of silly via another TikTok, explain the world record of paper folding via yet another TikTok, and then talk about cool math associated with paper folding.   

The faculty guest is Sarah Watson.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS23-09-22.pdf)]
