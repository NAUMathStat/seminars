The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

### New Results on Sylver Coinage

**Date:** January 19, 2024

**Speakers:** Natalie Burton and Tara Zurick (NAU undergraduates)

**Abstract:** Sylver coinage is a game played on the natural numbers; if you want to know the game rules, come to FAMUS!  Natalie and Tara, along with fellow undergrads James Warner and Morgan Boyers, have been working together for about 5 months trying to prove some Sylver coinage "claims" made by (among others) John Conway and Richard Guy.  And they have been successful; come and see just how much they have proven!  

The faculty guest is Mikhail Baltushkin.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS24-01-19.pdf)]
