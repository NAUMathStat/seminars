The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes place in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by [Jeff Rushall](https://nau.edu/cefns/natsci/math/directory-full-time/rushall-jeff/).

Come join us for some entertaining talks!  Refreshments always served.

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Hamilton and the Quaternions

**Date:** October 12, 2018

**Speaker:** Brent Pohlmann (Cal State University Maritime Academy.)

**Abstract:** In this talk we will give an overview of number systems, eventually dening the quaternions. There is very interesting, current research involving the quaternions, which will also be presented. Along the way we'll talk about Sir William Rohan Hamilton, perhaps the only famous mathematician to come from Ireland.  

This week's guest is also Brent Pohlmann. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-10-12.pdf)]

### The Urinal Problem, Part I

**Date:** October 5, 2018

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** Many real-life scenarios involving "public" privacy situations have been mathematized.  These include where to sit in a theater to avoid having people beside or in front of you, where to sit on an open-seat flight to maximize the chances of having an extra/empty seat next to you, etc.  Another such situation is urinal selection in a bathroom.  I will discuss how this situation gets mathematized, its connection to other math problems, and show plenty of pictures (the result of exhaustive fieldwork on my part).  And yes, there will be a "Part II" sometime in the not-too-distant future.

This week's guest is Sal Vera (NAU). [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-10-05.pdf)]

### Sexy Primes

**Date:** September 28, 2018

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 with exactly two distinct positive integer divisors.  The distribution of primes amongst the rest of the natural numbers is something of a mystery, but some types of primes are easy and fun to ponder. One semi-interesting subset of primes are integer pairs of the form $(n, n+6)$ where both $n$ and $n+6$ are prime, which are known as "sexy primes."  I will present some entertaining facts about primes in general, and sexy primes in particular.

This week's guest is Ellie Kennedy (NAU). [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-28.pdf)]

### NSF REU @ MCMCS

**Date:** September 21, 2018

**Speaker:** Riley Waechter (NAU)

**Abstract:** This past summer I traveled to Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania to participate in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program (now that you know what REU stands for, gold star to anybody who can figure out all 3 acronyms in the title). I will detail what the program was like in many aspects: day-to-day life, "extracurricular" activities, and of course, the math. As far as the math is concerned, I worked on two different projects this summer. We will begin by briefly diving into combinatorial game theory to discuss nimbers (or Sprague-Grundy values) of the game of Node-Kayles played on certain families of graphs. We will then switch gears to discuss the domination number of permutation graphs on n vertices. Finally, we will conclude by examining the application process for REU programs.

This week's guest is Ian Williams (NAU). [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-21.pdf)]

### The Dating Game

**Date:** September 14, 2018

**Speaker:** [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) (NAU)

**Abstract:** You're single and looking for love. In front of you are three doors. Behind each door is a prospective partner. Let’s assume that of the three people who are waiting behind the doors, there is a best match, a not so good match, and a least good match for you. Your mission is to couple up with your best possible match. Thankfully, I’m going to let you open some doors. But there are rules! To start, you select a door. It will open to reveal one of your potential suitors. If you want to choose this person as your match, you’re done and you don’t get to see either of the others. Risky! If you decide to move on, you discard the first person and they’re history. You select one of the two remaining doors. It opens to reveal someone else and again, you can choose this person as your match. But just like before, if you choose this person, you don’t get to see who is behind the final door. Nor are you allowed to return to the person you discarded behind the first door. If you decide to move on a second time, you select the final door. You must choose the person behind it as your match, whatever you think of them. Also risky! What strategy gives you the best chance of finding your best match?

This week's guest is also Dana Ernst - but his interview is going to be more of a "telling stories about his summer," most notably some little bike race he did in Colorado. [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-14.pdf)]

### What did I do this summer?

**Date:** September 9, 2018

**Speaker:** Jeff Rushall (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will talk about the math I did, the traveling I did (to some semi-exotic places), and show you some really neat pictures (involving both math and traveling).

The guests this week are department staff Bea Gallegos, Melina Miller and Mary Fule.  [[PDF of Flyer]({{ site.baseurl }}/famus_files/FAMUS18-09-07.pdf)]
