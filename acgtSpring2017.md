Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Factorizations of the longest element: wiring diagrams and higher Bruhat orders ###

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Dates:** 1/31/2017, 2/7/2017, 2/14/2017

**Abstract:** Having established last time the representation of rank-three oriented matroids matroids by wiring diagrams, weâ€™ll finish that discussion by showing that wiring diagrams in the uniform case correspond to factorizations of the longest permutation. We will then describe the higher Bruhat orders, and at least state the result relating the number of elements to such factorizations. An interpretation of this result is that the number of factorizations is the number of chambers of a certain hyperplane arrangement.

### Oriented matroids, wiring diagrams, factorizations of the long permutation ###

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Date:** 1/24/2017

**Abstract:** We will explain the relationship between oriented matroids, arrangements of pseudo-spheres, and, in rank three, wiring diagrams, and use this to establish the bijective correspondence between rank-three oriented matroids and admissible sequences of permutations. Specializing to the case of uniform oriented matroids, one deduces that the number of isomorphism classes, up to re-orientation, of uniform rank-three oriented matroids on $n+1$ points is equal to the number of factorizations of the longest element in the Coxeter system of type $A$.
