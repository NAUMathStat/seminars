# Schedule Spring 2017 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Factorizations of the longest element: wiring diagrams and higher Bruhat orders ###

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Date:** 1/31/2017

**Abstract:** Coming soon.

### Oriented matroids, wiring diagrams, factorizations of the long permutation ###

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Date:** 1/24/2017

**Abstract:** We will explain the relationship between oriented matroids, arrangements of pseudo-spheres, and, in rank three, wiring diagrams, and use this to establish the bijective correspondence between rank-three oriented matroids and admissible sequences of permutations. Specializing to the case of uniform oriented matroids, one deduces that the number of isomorphism classes, up to re-orientation, of uniform rank-three oriented matroids on $n+1$ points is equal to the number of factorizations of the longest element in the Coxeter system of type $A$.
