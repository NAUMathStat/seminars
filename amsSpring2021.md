title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

**AMS is on hold until the pandemic subsides.**

The AMS typically meets at 12:45-1:45PM on Thursdays in Room 146 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

Contact the AMS organizer [Jim Swift](mailto:Jim.Swfit@nau.edu) if you have questions.
