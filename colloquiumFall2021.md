**Title:** Topological Dynamics: An Operator Algebraic Approach

**Abstract:** An operator algebra is an algebra of bounded linear operators acting on a Hilbert space that is closed in a certain norm topology. When that algebra is closed with respect to the adjoint operation (an abstract conjugate transpose), we call it a $C\*$ -algebra. The prototypical examples of $C\*$ -algebras include the ring of $ n \\times n $ matrices over the complex numbers and the ring of complex-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space. The latter example gives an algebraic perspective for studying topological dynamics. In particular, one can build an operator algebra called a crossed product that encodes the dynamical information of a group of homeomorphisms acting on a topological space.

In the 1960s, W. Arveson determined that the action of a homeomorphism on a topological space is better encoded in a crossed product via the action of a semigroup on that space, rather than a group, which led to many important results in operator algebra theory. 

I will discuss how and why operator algebraists have been returning to crossed products in the context of groups acting on non-adjoint closed operator algebras, and I will discuss a recent partial solution to when dynamics are encoded fully in this crossed product context.

**Title:** Impacts of vaccination, Alpha and Delta variants on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.

**Abstract:**
To predict the future course of COVID-19 pandemic in each of the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the US, we extended the SIR model to a comprehensive dynamical system with 42 ODEs accounting for the following impacts, multiple periods of social distancing, vaccination rate, transmissibility of Alpha and Delta variants, vaccine effectiveness for different variants. For each MSA, we used the adaptive MCMC approach to generate samples of the posterior distribution for the adjustable parameters and performed uncertainty quantification. In the process, we obtained estimates of the relative infectiousness of Alpha and Delta as well as their takeoff times in each MSA. With the daily reports of new COVID-19 cases available from January 21, 2020 to August 24, 2021, the region-specific models predict that the current surge will plateau in September, 2021 for most cities. Model parameterizations and the predictions are being updated daily as new surveillance and vaccination data become available, prediction results can be found in the following  <a href="https://github.com/lanl/COVID-19-Predictions/tree/master/dailyForecasts/MSA">GitHub site</a>.

**Title:** BLIS: A Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces

**Abstract:**
The Equivariant Branching Lemma (EBL) is an important tool in equivariant (symmetric) bifurcation theory. The study of coupled cell networks is a hot topic in dynamical systems. It has been noticed in recent years that the structure of networks can cause invariant subspaces in the dynamics that are not caused by symmetry. As a result, the EBL does not describe some of the observed bifurcations. We present a generalization of the EBL that predicts the branching of solutions in a wide variety of situations, and lends itself to implementation as a numerical algorithm. We call this a Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces (BLIS).

**Title:** Optimizing ROC Curves with a Sort-Based Surrogate Loss Function for Binary Classification and Changepoint Detection

**Abstract:** Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plots of true positive rate versus false positive rate which are useful for evaluating binary classification models, but difficult to use for learning since the Area Under the Curve (AUC) is non-convex. ROC curves can also be used in other problems that have false positive and true positive rates such as changepoint detection. We show that in this more general context, the ROC curve can have loops, points with highly sub-optimal error rates, and AUC greater than one. This observation motivates a new optimization objective: rather than maximizing the AUC, we would like a monotonic ROC curve with AUC=1 that avoids points with large values for Min(FP,FN). We propose a convex relaxation of this objective that results in a new surrogate loss function called the AUM, short for Area Under Min(FP, FN). Whereas previous loss functions are based on summing over all labeled examples or pairs, the AUM requires a sort and a sum over the sequence of points on the ROC curve. We show that AUM directional derivatives can be efficiently computed and used in a gradient descent learning algorithm. In our empirical study of supervised binary classification and changepoint detection problems, we show that our new AUM minimization learning algorithm results in improved AUC and comparable speed relative to previous baselines.
