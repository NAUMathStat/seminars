title: Teaching Showcase
---

The Teaching Showcase provides an opportunity for professional development focused on the best practices of teaching. It is our hope that all attendees will learn from the expertise of their colleagues and be in a state of continuous improvement in the classroom as an instructor. These talks will be especially helpful to those new to teaching, providing support and useful ideas for their classrooms. The Teaching Showcase meets 3-4 times each semester.

The Department of Mathematics & Statistics takes pride in the overall quality of instruction and the amount of scholarly teaching that occurs. The department is engaged in a number of student-centered initiatives, which you can read about [here](http://nau.edu/CEFNS/NatSci/Math/Innovative-Teaching/).

# Schedule for Spring 2015 #

### A discussion about inquiry-based learning (part 2) ###

**Date:** January 21, 2015

**Speaker:** Dana Ernst

**Abstract:** In many mathematics classrooms, "doing mathematics" means following the rules dictated by the teacher, and "knowing mathematics" means remembering and applying these rules. However, an inquiry-based-learning (IBL) approach challenges students to create/discover mathematics. Boiled down to its essence, IBL is a method of teaching that engages students in sense-making activities. Rather than showing facts or a clear, smooth path to a solution, the instructor guides students via well-crafted problems through an adventure in mathematical discovery. In this talk, we will address the following questions: What is IBL? Why use IBL? What are some of the challenges of IBL? How can you incorporate more IBL into the classes that you teach? In addition, I will relay my personal experience and discuss how I came to IBL and where I plan to go with it.  Time permitting, we will also discuss a few different examples of what an IBL classroom might look like in practice.
