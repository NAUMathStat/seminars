# Schedule for Spring 2015 #

### A discussion about inquiry-based learning (part 2) ##

**Date:** January 21, 2015

**Speaker:** Dana Ernst

**Abstract:** In many mathematics classrooms, "doing mathematics" means following the rules dictated by the teacher, and "knowing mathematics" means remembering and applying these rules. However, an inquiry-based-learning (IBL) approach challenges students to create/discover mathematics. Boiled down to its essence, IBL is a method of teaching that engages students in sense-making activities. Rather than showing facts or a clear, smooth path to a solution, the instructor guides students via well-crafted problems through an adventure in mathematical discovery. In this talk, we will address the following questions: What is IBL? Why use IBL? What are some of the challenges of IBL? How can you incorporate more IBL into the classes that you teach? In addition, I will relay my personal experience and discuss how I came to IBL and where I plan to go with it.  Time permitting, we will also discuss a few different examples of what an IBL classroom might look like in practice.
