title: Week of April 10th.
---

There will be no colloquium this week, Tuesday April 11th. We do have a busy schedule of upcoming talks:

- April 18th	Phillip Doi	NAU	M.S. Thesis
- Honors Week, Dr. Luis David Garcia Puente, Sam Houston State University:
    - Thursday, April 27th 12:45 Colloquium
    - Thursday, April 27th 4:00 Student talk, awards, reception
    - Friday, April 28th 4:00 Interdisciplinary talk
- May 2nd	Zachary Parker NAU	M.S. Thesis

Additionally, in the coming weeks we expect to schedule at least two one-hour tenure-track candidate talks,
and several more shorter talks for the lecturer search.  It is important that a good showing
of faculty be present for each of these candidate talks, including hopefully a few graduate
students too.
