Dr. Jarrett Barber, Arizona State University: Emulating an individual based model of tree growth

Abstract: We wish to use large data sets to inform an individual based model for learning about tree growth and forest dynamics 
over regional scales and more broadly.  The computational complexity of our model and our 
regional scope make traditional approaches to Bayesian estimation and forecasting, e.g., MCMC, practically infeasible.  
To address the computational issue, we borrow perspective from the complex computer experiments literature to 
view our model as a complex simulator for which the goal is to create a computationally more tractable emulator model.  
From this perspective our situation is relatively unique because we can run our simulator a relatively large number of times, 
and we have a large number of actual observations, two situations that are relatively rare in this context.  
Consequently, with many data and simulator runs, 
the familiar use of Gaussian processes as the basis of emulation becomes problematic.  
We will review the
emulator literature and explore initial efforts to develop an emulator to calibrate our simulator and to predict tree growth.
