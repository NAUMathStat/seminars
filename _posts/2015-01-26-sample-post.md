I'm imagining using mini blog posts to advertise each week's announcements.  Each blog post will be a unique file in the `_posts` folder.  The filename should have the following convention: `year-month-day-short-title.md`.  For example, this post is named `2015-01-26-sample-post.md`.

Each post must begin with the following header:

```

layout: post
title: Title of Post
---
```
The rest of the page should be authored in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), which is a light weight mark-up language.  You can find a nice Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code).  You can also use between the dollar-signs $\LaTeX$ snippets.  However, some characters will need to be escaped with an extra backslash.

Each new post will automatically appear at the top of the homepage.  In addition, each post will automatically get catalogued on the [archive page]({{ site.baseurl }}/archive).

At this point, we need to just add a little content to each of the seminar pages.  I'm imagining a short description and a brief schedule.
