The Applied Mathematics Seminar (AMS) typically meets on Thursdays in the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

For Spring 2022 we are meeting from 12:45-1:45 PM in room 162 of the Adel Mathematics Building.
