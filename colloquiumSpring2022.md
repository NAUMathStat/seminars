**Title:** 
Families of Regular Hypergraphs in Regular Hypermaps

**Abstract:** 
The study of which regular (i.e. symmetric) graphs can be the skeleton of a regular
map (an embedding into a surface) has a long-ish history.  We have theorems saying
for which values of $n$ the complete graph $K_n$ is symmetrically embeddable. Ditto for
$K_n,n$ and the $n$-dimensional cube.

The generalizations to HYPERgraphs and HYPERmaps are much less familiar.  We
will examine symmetry in these more general cases, and we will find, after a suitable
introduction, that they have an unexpected charm.

**Title:** 
Living Proof: Lessons learned from Black mathematicians

**Abstract:**
Historically, Black students have been both underrepresented and marginalized in the field of mathematics. The research project I will talk about seeks to understand the stories of Black Americans who have been successful in the field of mathematics. With an understanding of the obstacles each Black mathematician in this study has faced and the tools that have helped them to overcome these hurdles, I will discuss how the findings can help support Black mathematicians and other underrepresented groups in mathematics programs.
