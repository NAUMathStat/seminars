### Graphic braid groups and tilings

**Date:** September 17

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** One can associate to a graph G a natural (sub)quotient of the full braid group, called a graphic braid group. We will define this notion, and illustrate how the symmetry group of the isosceles right triangle tiling of the plane arises in this way from the path of length two. I will also use part of the period to flesh out my sabbatical report from last Tuesdayâ€™s colloquium, with pictures and stories.
