### Taxonomy of braid graphs in Coxeter systems of types $A$ and $D$

**Date:** October 29

**Speaker:** [Dana C. Ernst](http:/danaernst.com) (NAU)

**Abstract:** A Coxeter group can be thought of as a generalized reflection group, where the group is generated by a set of elements of order two and there are rules for how the generators interact with each other. Every element of a Coxeter group can be written as an expression in the generators, and if the number of generators in an expression is minimal, we say that the expression is reduced. Any two reduced expressions for the same group element are related by a sequence of commutations and so-called braid moves. We say that two reduced expressions are braid equivalent if they are related via a sequence of braid moves, and the corresponding equivalence classes are called braid classes. Each braid class can be encoded in terms of a braid graph, where each vertex is an element of the braid class and two vertices are connected by an edge whenever the corresponding reduced expressions are related via a single braid move. We will summarize recent progress concerning the taxonomy of braid graphs for Coxeter groups of types $A$ and $D$. Joint work with Fadi Awik, Jadyn Breland, Quentin Cadman, Jens Niemi, Jack Sullivan, and Jordan Wright.

### Graphic arrangement groups, II

**Date:** October 22

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** A simple graph determines a "graphic hyperplane arrangement," the complement of which is a "partial configuration space," whose fundamental group is a "GAG" (graphic arrangement group) or graphic pure braid group. This is a natural quotient of the pure braid group, with generators corresponding to edges of the graph and relations arising from 3- and 4-cliques. Not so much is known in general about these groups. We'll state a theorem and present an example supporting a conjecture that GAGs are isomorphic to subgroups of direct products of pure braid groups. (Joint work with Dan Cohen.)
