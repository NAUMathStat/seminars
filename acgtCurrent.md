### Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem for Impartial Combinatorial Games

**Date:** Feburary 28 and March 7, 2023

**Speaker:** Dana Ernst (NAU)

**Abstract:** The aim of this talk is to formalize some folklore from combinatorial game theory and to introduce a result that we can think of as the First Isomorphism Theorem for impartial games. All welcome!


### Chromatic numbers of graphs and "quantum" relaxations of these quantities

**Date:** February 21, 2023

**Speaker:** Samuel Harris (NAU)

**Abstract:** As the title suggests, I’ll present on the chromatic numbers of graphs and quantum relaxations of these quantities. All welcome!

### Codelassification of circle bundles over the two-dimensional sphere

**Date:** January 31 and February 7, 2023

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** I’ll present the classification of circle bundles over the two-dimensional sphere, with an ensuing discussion of the sheaves of local sections of complex line bundles over the complex projective line. All welcome!
