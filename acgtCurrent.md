### Binary Linear Codes from Graphs

**Date:** January 14, January 21

**Speaker:** Sudipta Mallik (NAU)

**Abstract:** A binary linear code of length n is a subspace of $\mathbb F_2^n$. I will start with a brief introduction to binary linear codes. Then I will present a construction of binary linear codes from graphs, in particular, by the generator matrix $[I_n|A]$ where A is the adjacency matrix of a graph on n vertices. Finally a graph theoretic interpretation of the minimum distance of such codes will be given.
