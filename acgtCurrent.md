Note:  The ACGT seminar is taking a hiatus while the omicron variant surges.

### Tuesday February 8 (via zoom), 15 (mode TBA), 22 (mode TBA)

**Speaker:** Jim Swift

**Title:** Polydiagonal subspaces, coupled cell networks, and Cayley digraphs

**Abstract:** A polydiagonal subspace of $\mathbb R^n$ is a linear subspace defined by equations of the form $x_i = \pm x_j$.
Such subspaces form patially a ordered set, which is also a lattice.  In coupled cell networks with linear coupling of the cells determined by an $n \times n$ matrix $A$,
the lattice of $A$-invariant polydiagonal subspaces describes the possible possible synchrony and anti-synchrony of the cells.
We consider examples where $A$ is the adjacency matrix of a weighted digraph obtained from the colored Cayley digraph of the groups $Z_2$, $Z_2 \times Z_2$, and $Q_8$ (the 8-element group of quaternions).  These talks describe work with Nandor Sieben, Eddie Nijholt, and Jack Eigen.
