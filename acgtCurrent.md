The Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Topology (ACGT) Seminar meets on Tuesdays at 12:40-1:30PM in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building. If you are interested in giving a talk, please contact [Mike Falk](mailto:Michael.Falk@nau.edu) or [Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com), ACGT coordinators.

# Schedule Spring 2022 #

<hr>

Note:  The ACGT seminar is on zoom while the omicron variant surges.

### Tuesday February 8, 15, and 22 (via zoom, 12:40 to 1:30)

**Speaker:** Jim Swift

**Title:** Polydiagonal subspaces, coupled cell networks, and Cayley digraphs

**Abstract:** A polydiagonal subspace of $\mathbb R^n$ is a linear subspace defined by equations of the form $x_i = \pm x_j$.
Such subspaces form a patially ordered set, which is also a lattice.  In coupled cell networks with the linear coupling of the $n$ cells determined by an $n \times n$ matrix $A$,
the lattice of $A$-invariant polydiagonal subspaces describes the possible synchrony and anti-synchrony of the cells.
Among other examples, we let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of a weighted digraph obtained from a Cayley digraph of the group $Q_8$ (the 8-element group of quaternions).  
These talks describe work with Nandor Sieben, Eddie Nijholt, and Jack Eigen.
