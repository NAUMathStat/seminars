### Graphic arrangement groups, II

**Date:** October 22

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** A simple graph determines a "graphic hyperplane arrangement," the complement of which is a "partial configuration space," whose fundamental group is a "GAG" (graphic arrangement group) or graphic pure braid group. This is a natural quotient of the pure braid group, with generators corresponding to edges of the graph and relations arising from 3- and 4-cliques. Not so much is known in general about these groups. We'll state a theorem and present an example supporting a conjecture that GAGs are isomorphic to subgroups of direct products of pure braid groups. (Joint work with Dan Cohen.)
