The Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Topology (ACGT) Seminar meets on Tuesdays at 1:00-1:50PM in Room 146 of the Adel Mathematics Building. If you are interested in giving a talk, please contact [Dana C. Ernst](http://danaernst.com), ACGT coordinator.

# Schedule Spring 2019 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### An Alternative Approach to Hierarchical Secret Sharing

**Date:** Tuesday, February 26

**Speaker:** Jonathan Wheelter (undergraduate at NAU)

**Abstract:** TBA

### Covering Spaces and the Fundamental Group

**Date:** Tuesday, February 5

**Speaker:** David Deville (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this talk I will introduce the fundamental group of a topological space, define covering spaces and outline a few basic connections between them. With a focus on explanatory examples from graph theory, this talk should be especially suitable for undergraduates.

### Tetravalent Tricirculant Graphs and the Woolly Hat graphs

**Date:** Tuesday, January 22

**Speaker:** Steve Wilson (NAU)

**Abstract:** Starting with the basics of graph symmetry, we will zoom into semi-regular symmetries and discuss diagrams of these symmetries.   We will consider existing classifications of trivalent circulant, bicirculant and tricirculant graphs, of tetravalent  circulant and bicirculant graphs and enter into the not-yet finished classification of tricirculant tetravalent graphs, including the most recalcitrant case, the Woolly hat graphs.
