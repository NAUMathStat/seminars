### Cyclic and Constacyclic self-dual codes over R_k

**Date:** 9/25/18

**Speaker:** Bahattin Yildiz (NAU)

**Abstract:** In this work, we consider constacyclic and cyclic self-dual codes over the rings $R_k$. We start with theoretical existence results for constacyclic and cyclic self-dual codes of any length over $R_k$ and then construct cyclic self-dual codes over $R_1 = F_2 + uF_2$ of even lengths from lifts of binary cyclic self-dual codes. We classify all free cyclic self-dual codes over R_1 of even lengths for which non-trivial such codes exist. In particular we demonstrate that our constructions provide a counter example to a claim made by Batoul et al. in 2014 and we explain why their claim fails.

### Exploring signed permutations of maximal reversal length

**Date:** 9/4/18, 9/11/18

**Speaker:** Tanner Rosenberg (NAU)

**Abstract:** One can model a configuration of genes as a permutation of the numbers 1 through $n$, where each number can be right-side-up or upside-down. In this model, one type of mutation corresponds to performing a 180-degree reversal. The reversal distance between two configurations of genes is the minimum number of reversals needed to convert the permutation corresponding to one gene configuration to the other. Although there are other types of mutations, we focus on reversals since they are the most common mutation and reversal distance provides a good estimate for genetic distance. While the maximal reversal distance among all permutations of 1 through $n$ and the identity permutation is known, in this presentation we discuss our progress toward describing the structure of permutations that attain the maximal reversal distance.
