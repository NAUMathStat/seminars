### The Wooly Hat Problem Is Solved!

**Date:** October 25

**Speaker:** Steve Wilson (NAU retired)

### Invariant polynomials and discriminants of finite complex reflection groups

**Date:** October 18

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** We will discuss the classical discriminant (e.g., in degree two: $b^2-4ac=0$) and invariant polynomials and discriminants of finite complex reflection groups.

### Introduction to Shepherd groups

**Date:** October 11

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** We will have an informal discussion about Shepherd groups.

### Twin groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, and braid classes

**Date:** September 27, October 4
