### Thursday 1/19 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Dr. Robert Lund (University of California, Santa Cruz)

**Title:** Correlated Statistical Count Structures.

**Abstract:** This talk overviews the statistical modeling of correlated count structures, including time series, spatial random fields, and space-time processes. In the time series setting, which constitutes the majority of this talk, some history and recent breakthroughs are presented. Classical approaches to the problem and their drawbacks are first reviewed. Next, a Gaussian copula is used to produce an extremely flexible count time series model that is naturally parsimonious, can have negative autocorrelations and/or long-memory features, can easily accommodate covariates, and can be statistically fitted by likelihood methods. An application to annual no-hitter counts in Major League baseball is given. The talk closes with extensions of the methods to the spatial and space-time settings.

### Thursday 1/24 at 4:00-4:50

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Title:** A non-$K(\pi,1)$ factored line arrangement.

**Abstract:** In 1995 Luis Paris showed that arrangements of lines in the complex projective plane that are defined by equations with real coefficients and satisfy a certain factorization property have aspherical complements. More recently Gerhard Roehrle and his collaborators showed that the arrangement defined by the polynomial $Q(x,y,z)=x(x^3-y^3)(x^3-z^3)(y^3-z^3)(x+y+rz)$, where $r$ is a third root of 1, is factored. Recently I found a way to show this arrangement does not have aspherical complement, showing Paris' theorem does not extend to arbitrary complex line arrangements. In this talk I'll explain the context of the problem and sketch the entertaining proof, which amounts to elementary analytic geometry, albeit working in the complex plane, with an appearance of the main theorem of stratified Morse theory at the end. If there is time I'll explain the connection with the pencils of curves that appear on Jim Swift's web page. Joint work with Roehrle, aided by a long discussion during finals week with Michele Torielli and Quinn Beck.

**Title:** Bootstrap Percolation on Random Geometric Graphs

**Abstract:** Bootstrap percolation is a discrete-time process that models the spread of information or disease across the vertex set of a graph. We consider the following version of this process: Initially, each vertex of the graph is set active with probability $p$ or inactive otherwise. Then, at each time step, every inactive vertex with at least $k$ active neighbors becomes active. Active vertices will always remain active. The process ends when it reaches a stationary state. If all the vertices eventually become active, then we say we achieve percolation. This process has been widely studied on many families of graphs, deterministic and random. We analyze the bootstrap percolation process on a random geometric graph. A random geometric graph is obtained by choosing $n$ vertices uniformly at random from the unit $d$-dimensional cube or torus, and joining any two vertices by an edge if they are within a certain distance, $r$, of each other. We obtain very precise results that characterize the final state of the bootstrap percolation process in terms of the parameters $p$ and $r$ with high probability as the number $n$ of vertices tends to infinity.
