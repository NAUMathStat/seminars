title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

The Applied Mathematics Seminar (AMS) typically meets at 3:00-4:00PM on Thursdays in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

Sept 9: Jonathan Olson, "Tricomi's Equation and the (so-called) Polar Laplacian"

September 2: Ryan Kelly, "One-Dimensional Birkhoff Interpolation"
