title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

The Applied Mathematics Seminar (AMS) typically meets on Thursdays in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

### Fall, 2021 Schedule

In Fall 2021 we are meeting from **3:00 to 4:00** in room **164** of the Adel Mathematics Building.

**November 18: Ye Chen**

**November 11:** Veterans Day

**October 28, November 4: Jim Swift**, "Finite Difference Approximations of the Eigenvalues of the Laplacian"\
We focus on eigenvalues the Laplacian on regions in the plane, with either 0 Dirichlet or 0 Neumann boundary conditions.
(This means that either u = 0, or the normal derivative of u = 0.) An outline of a way to get an order h^2 computation of the Neumann eigenvalues 
for a general region in the plane is presented.
One of our former Master's students have tried and failed to do this.

**October 14, 21: Rachel Neville**, "Topological Data Analysis"

**October 7: Mikhail Baltushkin**, "A Numerical Investigation of the Double Pendulum"

**September 30: Shafiu Jibrin**, "The Weighted Analytic Center for Linear Matrix Inequalities"\
We study the problem of computing the weighted analytic center for linear matrix inequality constraints. We apply and compare conjugate gradient (CG) methods to find the weighted analytic center.  We use Newton's method exact line search and Quadratic Interpolation inexact line search.  The results indicate that both line searches work well with the methods, but exact line search handles weights better than the inexact line search when some weight is relatively much larger than the other weights. 

**September 23: John Neuberger**, "Spline ODE Solvers"

**September 16: Arthur Boggs**, "The Mathematics behind Modern Digital Communications"\
We apply radio theory, information theory, sampling theory, and coding theory to modern digital
communications, which, understandably, relies heavily on digital signal processing. One might say Henry
Morse sent the first digital signal in 1844 via his invention of the telegraph. Soon after, James Clerk
Maxwell laid out the theory of electromagnetic radiation in 1865 with his famous set of partial
differential equations combining electricity and magnetism. Heinrich Hertz applied Maxwellâ€™s equations
and built the first digital radio, the spark-gap transmitter and receiver in 1889. This leads us to the
modern era where wireless communications are ubiquitous. We now use most of the electromagnetic
spectrum from DC to light for all manner of communications. We will combine the relevant mathematics
behind radio theory, information theory, sampling theory, and coding theory to gain a mathematical
understanding of modern digital communications.

**September 9: Jonathan Olson**, "Tricomi's Equation and the (so-called) Polar Wave Equation"

**September 2: Ryan Kelly**, "One-Dimensional Birkhoff Interpolation"
