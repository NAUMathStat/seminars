title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

The Applied Mathematics Seminar (AMS) typically meets on Thursdays in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics.

### Fall, 2021 Schedule

In Fall 2021 we are meeting from **3:00 to 4:00** in room **164** of the Adel Mathematics Building.

**September 23: John Neuberger**, "Spline ODE Solvers"

**September 16: Arthur Boggs**, "The Mathematics behind Modern Digital Communications"\
We apply radio theory, information theory, sampling theory, and coding theory to modern digital
communications, which, understandably, relies heavily on digital signal processing. One might say Henry
Morse sent the first digital signal in 1844 via his invention of the telegraph. Soon after, James Clerk
Maxwell laid out the theory of electromagnetic radiation in 1865 with his famous set of partial
differential equations combining electricity and magnetism. Heinrich Hertz applied Maxwellâ€™s equations
and built the first digital radio, the spark-gap transmitter and receiver in 1889. This leads us to the
modern era where wireless communications are ubiquitous. We now use most of the electromagnetic
spectrum from DC to light for all manner of communications. We will combine the relevant mathematics
behind radio theory, information theory, sampling theory, and coding theory to gain a mathematical
understanding of modern digital communications.

**September 9: Jonathan Olson**, "Tricomi's Equation and the (so-called) Polar Wave Equation"

**September 2: Ryan Kelly**, "One-Dimensional Birkhoff Interpolation"
