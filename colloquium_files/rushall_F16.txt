The generic title is just fine.
 
Abstract: I will share the work of my 2015-2016 sabbatical year in Lisbon, Portugal. My main goal was to investigate a “Math Trail” at NAU/Flagstaff and look into developing a First Year Seminar course with a possible project connected to designing a Math Trail.  I will discuss
 
·         The progress made and preliminary use of my work.
·         Other professional activities I engaged in while in Portugal.
·         A few details of daily life.
·         A few fun travel stories.
