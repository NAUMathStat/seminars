### Tuesday 9/5 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Dana Ernst
**Title:** Sabbatical report

**Abstract:** 
I'll spend the first several minutes summarizing my sabbatical experience and then dive into one of the projects I worked on. In particular, I'll discuss some recent results my collaborators and I obtained concerning the structure of impartial games and rulesets, as well as the structure preserving maps between them. In some sense this work can be thought of as formalizing and extending some folklore from combinatorial game theory. This work was initiated at the Combinatorial Game Theory Colloquium in the Azores that I attended in January, and is joint work with Bojan Bašić, Paul Ellis, Danijela Popović, and Nándor Sieben.

### Tuesday 9/12 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Jim Swift
**Title:** Synchrony and Anti-Synchrony in Coupled Cell Networks

**Abstract:** 
The internal state of a cell in a coupled cell network is often described by an element of a vector space. Synchrony or anti-synchrony occurs when some of the cells are in the same or the opposite state. Of special interest are the evenly tagged anti-synchrony subspaces in which the number of cells in a certain state is equal to the number of cells in the opposite state.
We apply these results to systems of coupled van der Pol oscillators, and coupled Lorenz equations.

This is joint work with Eddie Nijholt and Nándor Sieben
