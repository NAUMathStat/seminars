### Tuesday 1/23 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Jaechoul Lee
**Title:** An efficient least squares algorithm for periodic time series regression

**Abstract:** 
Periodic and autoregressive data like daily temperatures or sales of seasonal products can be seen in periods fluctuating between highs and lows throughout the year. Generalized least squares (GLS) estimators are frequently computed for such periodic data, because these estimators are minimum variance unbiased estimators. However, the GLS solution can require extremely demanding computations when the data is large. We develop an efficient GLS algorithm in several periodic regression settings. The algorithm can substantially simplify GLS computations by compressing large sets of data into smaller sets. This is accomplished by constructing a structured matching matrix for dimension reduction. Simulations show that the new computation methods using our algorithm can drastically reduce the GLS computing time. Our algorithm can be easily adapted to many big data that shows periodic characteristics often pertinent to economics, environmental studies, and engineering practices. This talk should be accessible to any audience with knowledge on simple matrix operations.

### Tuesday 2/6 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Shafiu Jibrin
**Title:** On Second-Order Cone Functions

**Abstract:** 
We consider the second-order cone function (SOCF) $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
defined by $f(x)= c^T x + d -\|A x + b \|$, with parameters
$c \in \mathbb{R}^n$, $d \in \mathbb{R}$, $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$.
Every SOCF is concave. We give
necessary and sufficient conditions for strict concavity of $f$. 
The parameters $A$ and $b$ are not uniquely determined.
We show that every SOCF can be written in the 
form
$f(x) = c^T x + d -\sqrt{\delta^2 + (x-x_\star)^TM(x-x_\star)}$.
We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the parameters $c$, $d$, $\delta$,
$M = A^T A$, and $x_*$ to be uniquely determined.
We also give necessary and sufficient conditions for $f$ to be bounded above.

Our results have computational implications for convex optimization problems involving second-order constraints such as the problem of minimizing weighted barrier functions. They would allow one to recognize these optimization problems that can be solved efficiently, or to assist in reformulating those that are hard to solve.

This research is a joint work with Dr. James W. Swift.

**Speaker:** John Neuberger
**Title:** A Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces

**Abstract:** 
The Bifurcation from a Simple Eigenvalue (BSE) Theorem is the foundation of steady-state
bifurcation theory for one-parameter families of functions. When eigenvalues of multiplicity
greater than one are caused by symmetry, the Equivariant Branching Lemma (EBL) can
often be applied to predict the branching of solutions. The EBL can be interpreted as the
application of the BSE Theorem to a fixed point subspace. There are functions which have
invariant linear subspaces that are not caused by symmetry. For example, networks of
identical coupled cells often have such invariant subspaces. We present a generalization of
the EBL, where the BSE Theorem is applied to nested invariant subspaces. We call this the
Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces (BLIS). We give several examples of bifurcations
and determine if BSE, EBL, or BLIS apply. We extend our previous automated bifurcation
analysis algorithms to use the BLIS to simplify and improve the detection of branches
created at bifurcations.

**Title:** Problem solving for lazy mathematicians: the magic of constraint solvers

**Abstract:** 
Constraint programming often provides simple formulations of a wide variety of problems. We can simply describe what we want in a solution without knowing how to get it. State-of=art solvers can do the rest. We learn how to use a few lines of Python code to easily handle Jim's dress code puzzle, MAT 232 problems, Diophantine systems of inequalities, the send more money puzzle, and graph coloring.
