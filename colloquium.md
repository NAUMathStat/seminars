**Title:** Teacher-authored culturally responsive mathematics curriculum: Lessons from the Diné Institute for Navajo Nation Educators

**Abstract:** 
This presentation shares research conducted with a long-term professional development program for teachers in Navajo-serving schools, with a focus on the mathematics curriculum developed by teachers in this program. We address the research question: To what extent and in what ways do teachers in DINÉ math seminars develop curriculum units that evidence culturally responsive principles and mathematics education best practices? We analyze teacher-authored mathematics curriculum from two years of this program and share key lessons learned in supporting teachers from Indigenous-serving schools to engage culturally responsive principles in their math teaching and learning.

### Tuesday 9/10 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Jeffrey Covington
**Title:** Curve fitting and Gaussian process regression

**Abstract:** 
Gaussian process regression, also known as Kriging, is a powerful curve fitting and statistical regression tool which has grown in popularity over the past few years. I've found it to be a powerful tool in my own research in spatial and dynamical modeling. This talk will introduce (kernel-based) Gaussian processes and their applications, relate them to curve fitting through Gaussian process regression, and explore the power and pitfalls of the methods.
