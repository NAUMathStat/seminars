**Speaker:** Shannon Guerrero
**Title:** Teacher-authored culturally responsive mathematics curriculum: Lessons from the Diné Institute for Navajo Nation Educators

**Abstract:** 
This presentation shares research conducted with a long-term professional development program for teachers in Navajo-serving schools, with a focus on the mathematics curriculum developed by teachers in this program. We address the research question: To what extent and in what ways do teachers in DINÉ math seminars develop curriculum units that evidence culturally responsive principles and mathematics education best practices? We analyze teacher-authored mathematics curriculum from two years of this program and share key lessons learned in supporting teachers from Indigenous-serving schools to engage culturally responsive principles in their math teaching and learning.

### Tuesday 9/10 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Jeffrey Covington
**Title:** Curve fitting and Gaussian process regression

**Abstract:** 
Gaussian process regression, also known as Kriging, is a powerful curve fitting and statistical regression tool which has grown in popularity over the past few years. I've found it to be a powerful tool in my own research in spatial and dynamical modeling. This talk will introduce (kernel-based) Gaussian processes and their applications, relate them to curve fitting through Gaussian process regression, and explore the power and pitfalls of the methods.

### Tuesday 9/17 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Michele Torielli
**Title:** Hyperplane arrangements and signed graphs

**Abstract:** 
In this talk, we will recall the notion of hyperplane arrangement and discuss  when an arrangement is free. We will then discuss their connection with simple graphs and finally, generalize this connection to the notion of signed graphs.

### Tuesday 9/24 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Roy St. Laurent
**Title:** Diversions: My Favorite Logic Puzzles from Nikoli

**Abstract:** 
This is not a research talk. I will introduce three or four of my favorite Nikoli puzzles, with an opportunity for you to solve examples of them yourself. Paper copies will be provided, just bring a pencil (or pen).

Nikoli is a Japanese publisher that specializes in culture-independent puzzles – especially pencil/paper logic puzzles played on a rectangular grid. I have been hooked on Nikoli puzzles since being introduced to them by now-retired Mathematics professor Dr. Steve Wilson. The English names of some of my favorites are Akari, Fillomino, Hashiwokakero, Heyawake, Hitori, Kakuro, Nurikabe, Slitherlink, Yajilin.

While this isn’t a research talk, a couple of interesting questions come to mind that will be raised during the talk.

### Tuesday 10/15 at 4:00-4:50
**Speaker:** Peter Vadasz
**Title:** Magnetostrophic Flow and Electromagnetic Columns in Magneto-Fluid Dynamics and short updates on my previous presentations of Quantum Mechanics and Newtonian Gravitational Waves 

**Abstract:** 
An analogy between magneto-fluid dynamics (MFD/MHD) and geostrophic flow in a rotating frame of reference including the existence of electromagnetic columns identical to Taylor-Proudman columns is identified and demonstrated theoretically. The latter occurs in the limit of large values of a dimensionless group representing the magnetic field number. Such conditions are shown to be easily satisfied in reality. Consequently, the electromagnetic fluid flow subject to these conditions is two dimensional and the streamlines are being shown to be identical to the pressure lines in complete analogy to rotating geostrophic flows. An experimental setup is suggested to confirm the theoretical results experimentally.
