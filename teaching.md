title: Teaching Seminar
---

The Teaching Seminar provides an opportunity for professional development focused on the best practices of teaching. It is our hope that all attendees will learn from the expertise of their colleagues and be in a state of continuous improvement in the classroom as an instructor. These talks will be especially helpful to those new to teaching, providing support and useful ideas for their classrooms. The Teaching Seminar meets once or twice a month at 4:00-5:00PM on Thursdays.  If you have questions about the Teaching Seminar or are interested in giving a talk, please contact [Matt Fahy](mailto:Matthew.Fahy@nau.edu).

The Department of Mathematics & Statistics takes pride in the overall quality of instruction and the amount of scholarly teaching that occurs. The department is engaged in a number of student-centered initiatives, which you can read about [here](http://nau.edu/CEFNS/NatSci/Math/Innovative-Teaching/).

# Schedule for Spring 2024 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### AI in the Mathematics Classroom

**Date:** Thursday, January 25, 2024

**Speaker:** Dane Jacobson (Yuma Unified High School District)

**Abstract:** Dane will lead a discussion of generative AI in the context of mathematics education.  Dane will demonstrate and discuss how AI tools can be (and are!) used by students to solve mathematics problems across a range of difficulties, content areas, and levels of abstraction.  In light of the ubiquity of these tools, he will then discuss how we as teachers can reframe assignments and assessments and how we can model responsible use of these tools for students.
 
Dane is an alumnus of our department who currently teaches in the Yuma Unified High School District.  He is a member of the YUHSD Educational Technology AI Team and leads professional development seminars regarding generative AI throughout his district.  Starting next academic year, Dane will be working as a full member of the YUHSD Ed Tech staff, overseeing technology use and implementation for the over 11,000 students and 500 staff of the 7 YUHSD high schools. 

### All about assessment

**Date:** Thursay, March 7 

**Speaker:** Katie Louchart and Shannon Guerrero (NAU)

**Abstract:** Are you teaching an online course this summer and want to know details about online test proctoring?  Would you like to consider alternative assessments besides “traditional” paper-and-pencil tests (online or otherwise)?  Come to this Teaching Seminar session to hear all about these assessment topics and more.

### Mathematics Placement: Past, Present, and Future

**Date:** Thursday, January 25, 2024

**Speaker:** Matt Fahy (NAU)

**Abstract:** I will lead a discussion of math placement’s past, present and future: a brief overview of the placement process, how it has changed in recent years, and modifications that might/should/could/better not be considered moving forward.
