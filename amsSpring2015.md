title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---
The AMS typically meets 12:45-1:45 on Thursdays in Room #164.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynammical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics. If you are interested/willing to give a talk, please contact John.Neuberger@NAU.Edu, Colloquium Chair and AMS Coordinator, Spring 2015.
