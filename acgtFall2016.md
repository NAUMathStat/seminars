Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### When is $PX(n,k)$ Cayley? ###

**Dates:** 9/27/2016, 10/4/2016

**Abstract:** We will start by just talking about Cayley graphs and digraphs. If $G$ is a group, a Cayley graph of $G$ is a way to make pictorial the inner workings of the group, to understand its actions in a visual way.  We will show some examples and see how the graph can illuminate the group.  Then we will ask the question:  given a graph, how can you tell if it is a Cayley graph for some group?  And what group?  And how? With that expertise established, we will turn our attention to the hated-and-feared Praeger-Xu graphs $PX(n,k)$.   We will talk about the symmetries of the graph, and why its large group of symmetries makes it, counter-intuitively, difficult to handle. Then, after we have done all of that, we will seek some partial answers to the title question.

### Grassmannians, families of arrangements, and Bruhat order ###

**Dates:** 9/6/2016, 9/13/2016, 9/20/2016

**Abstract:** In this series of three lectures, we will study the space of generic hyperplane arrangements as a subset of the Grassmannian, motivating the (dual) definition(s) of Manin-Schechtman discriminantal arrangements, which generalize the Coxeter arrangements of type $$A. The so-called higher Bruhat order is defined using these arrangements, and is related to the infamous Heroin Hero problem for Coxeter groups; we will try to elucidate the connection. In the third lecture weâ€™ll investigate possible generalization of the construction to a certain good compactification of the space of generic arrangements.
