### Grassmannians, families of arrangements, and Bruhat order I ###

**Dates:** 9/6/2016, 9/13/2016, 9/20/2016

**Notes:** In this series of three lectures, we will study the space of generic hyperplane arrangements as a subset of the Grassmannian, motivating the (dual) definition(s) of Manin-Schechtman discriminantal arrangements, which generalize the Coxeter arrangements of type $$A. The so-called higher Bruhat order is defined using these arrangements, and is related to the infamous Heroin Hero problem for Coxeter groups; we will try to elucidate the connection. In the third lecture weâ€™ll investigate possible generalization of the construction to a certain good compactification of the space of generic arrangements.
