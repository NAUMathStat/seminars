Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Scattered Spaces and Classifying General Toronto Spaces ###

**Speaker:** Phillip Doi (NAU graduate student)

**Dates:** 10/25/2016, 11/1/2016

**Abstract:** In the realm of point-set topology, a Toronto space is a topological space, homeomorphic to each of its full cardinality subspaces.  Under certain conditions, Toronto spaces are easy to classify, particularly if they are not Hausdorff (not T2).  The challenge we consider lies in classifying Hausdorff Toronto spaces of uncountable cardinalities.  We will explore results and open questions about consistency that concern aleph one, T2, Toronto spaces, as well as their relationship to scatter spaces.  In this matter, we can come to natural generalizations of the original definition.  Furthermore, some new (albeit straightforward) results will be presented, which may have gone unnoticed in the cataloging of folklore about these spaces.

### When is $PX(n,k)$ Cayley? ###

**Speaker:** Steve Wilson (NAU emeritus)

**Dates:** 9/27/2016, 10/4/2016, 10/11/2016, 10/18/2016

**Abstract:** We will start by just talking about Cayley graphs and digraphs. If $G$ is a group, a Cayley graph of $G$ is a way to make pictorial the inner workings of the group, to understand its actions in a visual way.  We will show some examples and see how the graph can illuminate the group.  Then we will ask the question:  given a graph, how can you tell if it is a Cayley graph for some group?  And what group?  And how? With that expertise established, we will turn our attention to the hated-and-feared Praeger-Xu graphs $PX(n,k)$.   We will talk about the symmetries of the graph, and why its large group of symmetries makes it, counter-intuitively, difficult to handle. Then, after we have done all of that, we will seek some partial answers to the title question.

### Grassmannians, families of arrangements, and Bruhat order ###

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk(http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/) (NAU)

**Dates:** 9/6/2016, 9/13/2016, 9/20/2016

**Abstract:** In this series of three lectures, we will study the space of generic hyperplane arrangements as a subset of the Grassmannian, motivating the (dual) definition(s) of Manin-Schechtman discriminantal arrangements, which generalize the Coxeter arrangements of type $A$. The so-called higher Bruhat order is defined using these arrangements, and is related to the infamous Heroin Hero problem for Coxeter groups; we will try to elucidate the connection. In the third lecture weâ€™ll investigate possible generalization of the construction to a certain good compactification of the space of generic arrangements.
