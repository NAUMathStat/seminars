## Other Seminar Announcements ##

- [ACGT](acgtFall2016) The seminar series will meet at the usual time, 12:45-2:00 Tuesdays,

- [AMS](amsFall2016) The seminar series will meet at the usual time, 12:45-2:00 Thursdays, 
   #164. This week Etude Oneel-Judy will discuss “Modeling the Non-Euclidean Geometry of Flat Minkowski Space Using Projective Euclidean Surfaces.”   
	This physics project explores the conceptual and mathematical development of a new representation of flat Minkowski space that visually encodes the 
	geometric properties of flat spacetime.  Further work and potential applications of this model will be discussed.


- [FAMUS](famusFall2016) meets on Fridays, 3-4, AMB #164. 

The seminar schedules and announcements are available via the departmental seminar
