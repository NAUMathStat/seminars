### On Potentials Integrated by Nikiforov-Uvarov Method

**Date:** Thursday, September 7

**Speaker:** Lina Ellis

**Abstract:** We discuss basic potentials of the nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics that can be integrated in the Nikiforov and Uvarov paradigm with the aid of a computer algebra system. This consideration may help the readers to study analytical methods of quantum physics.
