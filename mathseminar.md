### Fall 2023 Schedule

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.

### Some quotients of exterior algebras and Grassmann geometry

**Dates:** Thursday, September 14; Thursday, September 21

**Speaker:** Michael Falk (NAU)

**Abstract:** I’ll give an update on the current state of our project to the classify Orlik-Solomon algebras using 2-isomorphism of hypergraphs, a joint project with Geoff Whittle. There will be an appearance of the (exterior)  Stanley-Reisner ring of a simplicial complex. I’ll focus on recent developments that involve the Grassmannian of $p$-planes in $n$-space and linear line complexes.

### On Potentials Integrated by Nikiforov-Uvarov Method

**Date:** Thursday, September 7

**Speaker:** Lina Ellis (NAU grad student)

**Abstract:** We discuss basic potentials of the nonrelativistic and relativistic quantum mechanics that can be integrated in the Nikiforov and Uvarov paradigm with the aid of a computer algebra system. This consideration may help the readers to study analytical methods of quantum physics.
