The "Friday Afternoon Mathematics Undergraduate Seminar" (FAMUS) is a weekly event consisting of announcements, talks, and faculty interviews.  FAMUS takes place most Fridays at 3:00-4:00pm in room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Typically the first half of FAMUS consists of a talk on a mathematical topic while an interview of a faculty member takes in the second half. FAMUS is hosted by Jeff Rushall.  

Come learn what mathematics is about and how the faculty ended up in our department at this popular event.
