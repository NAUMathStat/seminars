title: Applied Mathematics Seminar
---

The AMS typically meets 12:45-1:45PM on Thursdays in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building.  Any faculty, students, or friends of the department are welcome to attend. Seminar talks are typically rotated between faculty (and on occasion students or visitors) with research interests related to applied mathematics, widely defined to include almost anything from ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, nonlinear and linear functional analysis, numerical analysis, optimization, operations research, scientific computing, modeling, and advanced physics. 

# Fall 2018 #

The seminar is very informal and we don't post a schedule here. To find out this week's talk see the email sent out weekly,
or contact [Jim Swift](mailto:Jim.Swfit@nau.edu).

- 9/8/2016		Jeffrey Covington, on his research with Neuberger on
				the existence of solutions to semilinear elliptic PDE, particularly on the dumbell.
- 9/15/2016		Shafiu Jibrin, on Finding the inertia of a symmetric matrix.
- 9/22/2016		Jibrin continues.

- 10/6 			Blows - Population modeling.
- 10/13 		Blows
- 10/20 		Neuberger - O(h^2) second difference matrices.
- 10/27 		Etude Oneel-Judy will discuss
“Modeling the Non-Euclidean Geometry of Flat Minkowski Space Using Projective Euclidean Surfaces.”   This project explores the
conceptual and mathematical development of a new representation of flat Minkowski space that visually encodes the
geometric properties of flat spacetime.  Further work and potential applications of this model will be discussed.
