The talk this week is titled "A Report on the 2015 Nebraska Women's Conference", and is given by Ellie Kennedy, who is also the faculty guest.  This conference, which targets undergraduate women who study mathematics, was held just last weekend.  Ellie took several of our majors to the conference; among the student attendees, two presented a talk and two presented a poster, and they all have lots of pictures to show and stories to tell.

The talk this week is titled "The Biggest Number in the Universe" and is given by Jeff Rushall.  Believe it or not, some people HAVE crowned "the world's biggest number," and although not everyone agrees with their definition of "biggest" or with their choice of this "biggest number," it all makes for a fun presentation.  This biggest number, Graham's Number, is the answer to a question in Ramsey Theory.  Jeff will present background info and motivate the existence of this number, with can only be described using Knuth up-arrow notation.  There will be no faculty guest this week.
