### Simplicial complexes,square-free monomial ideals, and Stanley-Reisner rings.

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk] (NAU)

**Dates:** 01/23/18

**Abstract:** A square-free monomial ideal is an ideal in a multi-variable polynomial ring that is generated by monomials with no repeated factors. These naturally correspond to abstract simplicial complexes, and their algebraic structure is intimately connected to the combinatorial structure of the associated complex. For instance, they were originally used to characterize the face vectors of simplicial polytopes with rational vertices. I will define the relevant concepts, display some examples, and sketch the associated homological algebra and combinatorics.
