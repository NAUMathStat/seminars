### Recent Results in Quasi-Twisted and Related Codes, and Codes over Rings.

**Speaker:** [Noah (Nuh) Aydin] (Kenyon College)

**Dates:** 03/13/18

**Abstract:** One of the most important and challenging problems in coding theory is to construct codes with good parameters. A promising and fruitful approach has been to focus on the class of quasi-twisted (QT) codes which includes cyclic and constacyclic codes as a special case. In this talk, we will discuss some recent results, both computational and theoretical, related to QT codes.  Although constacyclic codes and QT codes have been the subject of numerous studies and computer searches over the last few decades, we have been able to discover a new fundamental result about the structure of constacyclic codes which was instrumental in our comprehensive search method for new QT codes. We also introduce a generalization of QT codes that we call multi-twisted (MT) codes and prove a number of facts about them. Finally, we will briefly mention some recent work on codes over various rings.

### Modules, fields of definition, and the Culler-Shalen norm.

**Speaker:** [Charles Katerba] (University of Montana)

**Dates:** 03/06/18

### Weak maps of matroids and higher resonance

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk] (NAU)

**Dates:** 02/27/18

### Structure of braid graphs for reduced expressions in Coxeter groups.

**Speaker:** [Dana Ernst] (NAU)

**Dates:** 02/13/18, 02/20/18

**Abstract:** A square-free monomial ideal is an ideal in a multi-variable polynomial ring that is generated by monomials with no repeated factors. These naturally correspond to abstract simplicial complexes, and their algebraic structure is intimately connected to the combinatorial structure of the associated complex. For instance, they were originally used to characterize the face vectors of simplicial polytopes with rational vertices. I will define the relevant concepts, display some examples, and sketch the associated homological algebra and combinatorics.

### The taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

**Speaker:** [Jim Swift] (NAU)

**Dates:** 01/30/18

**Abstract:** A square-free monomial ideal is an ideal in a multi-variable polynomial ring that is generated by monomials with no repeated factors. These naturally correspond to abstract simplicial complexes, and their algebraic structure is intimately connected to the combinatorial structure of the associated complex. For instance, they were originally used to characterize the face vectors of simplicial polytopes with rational vertices.
