The Algebra, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Topology (ACGT) Seminar meets on Tuesdays at 12:45-2:00pm in Room 164 of the Adel Mathematics Building. If you are interested/willing to give a talk, please contact [Dana C. Ernst](http://dcernst.github.io) or [Michael Falk](http://www.cefns.nau.edu/~falk/), ACGT Co-coordinators.

# Schedule Spring 2018 #

Note that talks are listed in reverse chronological order.


### Modules, fields of definition, and the Culler-Shalen norm.

**Speaker:** [Charles Katerba] (University of Montana)

**Dates:** 03/06/18

**Abstract:** A square-free monomial ideal is an ideal in a multi-variable polynomial ring that is generated by monomials with no repeated factors. These naturally correspond to abstract simplicial complexes, and their algebraic structure is intimately connected to the combinatorial structure of the associated complex. For instance, they were originally used to characterize the face vectors of simplicial polytopes with rational vertices. I will define the relevant concepts, display some examples, and sketch the associated homological algebra and combinatorics.

### Weak maps of matroids and higher resonance

**Speaker:** [Michael Falk] (NAU)

**Dates:** 02/27/18


### Structure of braid graphs for reduced expressions in Coxeter groups.
.

**Speaker:** [Dana Ernst] (NAU)

**Dates:** 02/13/18, 02/20/18

### The taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

**Speaker:** [Jim Swift] (NAU)

### Simplicial complexes,square-free monomial ideals, and Stanley-Reisner rings.
